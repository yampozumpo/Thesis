This was the first nationwide truce since 2016 and also contained agreements to allow two commercial flights into Sana?a airport each week, to open Hodeidah port to 18 fuel ships, and to begin discussions on opening blocked roads in Taiz. On 7 April 2022, ousted but internationally recognized President Hadi handed over his powers to a presidential council formed of eight members composed of both political and armed group leaders, which would be responsible for implementing the truce. The eight-man Presidential Leadership Council was formally sworn in on 19 April in Aden. Although this nationwide truce and the government reshuffle came as a surprise to even long-time Yemen analyst, some factors contributed to this outcome. Firstly, the Saudi-led coalition increasingly recognised that a military victory was unlikely, as Houthis missile and drone attacks on Saudi and Emirati territory increased, posing economic risks, and damaging the international reputations of these Gulf states. Secondly, President Biden's shift in US policy towards the coalition, ending ""offensive"" support, prompted the US to support UN-led negotiations. This combination of pressure and diplomatic engagement encouraged Saudi and Emirati leadership to seek an end to their involvement in the war. The appointment of the new UN special envoy, Hans Grundberg, also injected new life into the stalled UN process. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may view their disengagement from Yemen as part of a broader effort to establish a more functional relationship with Iran amidst the ongoing nuclear deal negotiations.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the charter of national reconciliation proposed by the Arab League tripartite committee. Among the attendees, there were 32 Christian legislators and 30 Muslim legislators. The talks were mediated by Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco, with the assistance of Lakhdar Brahimi, the Arab League's assistant Secretary-General. During the negotiations, Saudi Arabia reportedly provided financial incentives to encourage the parties involved in the peace process. Notably absent from the discussions were General Michel Aoun, who was advising the Christian parliamentarians from Beirut, as well as the leader of the Druze community, the leader of the Druze militia, and the leaders of the two major Shi'ite militias, Amal and Hezbollah. Additionally, the four external powers operating on Lebanese soil � Syria, Israel, Iran, and the Palestinians (both PLO and non-PLO) � were not present. The negotiations focused on three major issues: political reforms based on the Constitutional Document of 1976, the election of a new president, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory. The latter issue proved to be the most contentious and divisive. The meeting experienced a deadlock as Christian parliamentarians continued to insist on a specific commitment for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, with General Aoun advocating for an accelerated timetable. The Arab League committee finally proposed an amended plan on 21 October that stipulated that the Syrian and the Lebanese governments would decide �together� on Syrian troops redeployment, while the original plan stated that Syria would make this decision �in coordination� with Lebanon. The meeting held in Taif, Saudi Arabia, extended over a period of 23 days, culminating in the agreement known as the Taif Agreement on 22 October 1989. During the final vote, 59 deputies expressed their support for the agreement, one voted against it, and two chose to abstain. However, General Michel Aoun vehemently rejected the Taif agreement. His primary objection stemmed from the absence of a firm commitment to ensure the swift and complete withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, which he saw as a threat to Lebanon's sovereignty. Aoun further contended that the proposed political reforms within the agreement were inadequate, failing to address the fundamental political problems at hand and, therefore, deemed them unacceptable.",tarif,Saudi Arabia,1.0,1989,9.0,30.0,1989.0,10.0,22.0,1.0,0.0,1,"Arab League, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, marocco",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the charter of national reconciliation proposed by the Arab League tripartite committee. Among the attendees, there were 32 Christian legislators and 30 Muslim legislators. The talks were mediated by Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco, with the assistance of Lakhdar Brahimi, the Arab League�s assistant Secretary-General. During the negotiations, Saudi Arabia reportedly provided financial incentives to encourage the parties involved in the peace process. Notably absent from the discussions were General Michel Aoun, who was advising the Christian parliamentarians from Beirut, as well as the leader of the Druze community, the leader of the Druze militia, and the leaders of the two major Shi'ite militias, Amal and Hezbollah. Additionally, the four external powers operating on Lebanese soil � Syria, Israel, Iran, and the Palestinians (both PLO and non-PLO) � were not present. The negotiations focused on three major issues: political reforms based on the Constitutional Document of 1976, the election of a new president, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory. The latter issue proved to be the most contentious and divisive. The meeting experienced a deadlock as Christian parliamentarians continued to insist on a specific commitment for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, with General Aoun advocating for an accelerated timetable. The Arab League committee finally proposed an amended plan on 21 October 1989 that stipulated that the Syrian and the Lebanese governments would decide �together� on Syrian troops redeployment, while the original plan stated that Syria would make this decision �in coordination� with Lebanon. The meeting held in Taif, Saudi Arabia, extended over a period of 23 days, culminating in the agreement known as the Taif Agreement on October 22, 1989. During the final vote, 59 deputies expressed their support for the agreement, one voted against it, and two chose to abstain. However, General Michel Aoun vehemently rejected the Taif agreement. His primary objection stemmed from the absence of a firm commitment to ensure the swift and complete withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, which he saw as a threat to Lebanon�s sovereignty. Aoun further contended that the proposed political reforms within the agreement were inadequate, failing to address the fundamental political problems at hand and, therefore, deemed them unacceptable.",tarif,Saudi Arabia,1.0,1989,9.0,30.0,,,,,0.0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

Additionally, it included an amnesty provision, granting immunity to all rebel groups except those involved in acts of genocide. Furthermore, the peace agreement provided a roadmap for an Inter-Congolese Dialogue, which aimed at achieving a democratic transition through general elections. Participants in this dialogue would include the government, armed groups, as well as unarmed political forces within the country. The MLC signed the agreement on 1 August 1999. On 31 August, after intense diplomatic pressure, all 50 founding members of the fractious RCD signed. Rebel leader Emile Ilunga and 41 of his deputies signed on behalf of the RCD. This was a compromise following dispute between the two RCD factions about which group had the right to sign.

The parties involved in the agreement reaffirmed the ceasefire modalities established in the Lusaka Agreement, Kampala Withdrawal Plan, and Harare Sub-Agreement. These modalities aimed to halt hostilities and seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict. One of the key provisions was the formation of a restructured, integrated national army comprising fighters from different factions. A similar approach was applied to the police force, creating integrated units within the security sector. While no specific quotas were mentioned, the agreement emphasized the importance of equitable representation among the groups. The agreement specified the establishment of a Government of Unity for a transitional period lasting 24 months, followed by scheduled elections. Four vice presidents were appointed, representing the RCD, MLC, government, and political opposition. Joseph Kabila was allowed to remain in his position as president.

This meeting led to the signing of the Lusaka Accord by the regional states on 10 July 1999, but RCD and MLC initially refuse to sign. The agreement outlined several key provisions to bring about peace. It called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the halt of military movements, and the cessation of hostile propaganda. A crucial aspect was the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the DRC within a nine-month timeframe. To ensure compliance with the ceasefire and the disarmament of militia groups, a joint military commission, consisting of the warring parties and a UN/OAU observer group, would be established. The agreement also entailed the deployment of UN peacekeepers and the formation of a national army comprising both government and rebel forces. Additionally, it included an amnesty provision, granting immunity to all rebel groups except those involved in acts of genocide. Furthermore, the peace agreement provided a roadmap for an Inter-Congolese Dialogue, which aimed at achieving a democratic transition through general elections. Participants in this dialogue would include the government, armed groups, as well as unarmed political forces within the country. The MLC signed the agreement on 1 August 1999. On 31 August, after intense diplomatic pressure, all 50 founding members of the fractious RCD signed. Rebel leader Emile Ilunga and 41 of his deputies signed on behalf of the RCD.

Firstly, it established a ceasefire and required all troops to either remain in their current positions or be stationed in designated sites, where they would await demobilization or integration into the new armed forces. To monitor and supervise the ceasefire, a joint ceasefire commission was established, consisting of government delegates, representatives from the warring parties, as well as members from the UN, the OAU, and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi. The parties also agreed on the reform of the armed forces, with a 50-50 ethnic quota, ensuring equal representation of Hutus and Tutsis.

Similarly, Zaire and Egypt mediated in 1990, but could not bring the conflict parties to the negotiation table. The Government of Sudan took the initiative in March 1990 to request the US to mediate. The US subsequently initiated a mediation effort. In order to move the conflict parties towards a peace settlement, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen began to shuttle between the conflict parties in March 1990. Cohen formulated a proposal that stipulated the conclusion of a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, followed by a constitutional conference that would decide on a federal system. With regard to the withdrawal of troops, Cohen proposed the complete evacuation of the national army to positions north of the 11th parallel, while the SPLM/A had to guarantee that it would not take control of southern Sudan militarily if the government forces would withdraw. With neither conflict party agreeing to this proposal, Cohen subsequently formulated a new proposal, which stipulated that half of the government forces would be pulled out from southern Sudan, while the SPLM/A would in exchange withdraw all its troops 15 kilometres from the besieged towns. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops would be internationally monitored. Cohen also proposed to hold a constitutional conference. Cohen personally presented the adapted proposal to President al-Bashir in Khartoum on 9 March 1990. While al-Bashir promised Cohen to study the proposal carefully, he soon conveyed that he rejected the possibility of a constitutional conference, preferring bilateral talks with John Garrang. The Government of Sudan also refused to withdraw from some garrison towns in areas controlled by the rebels including some oil fields.

This agreement covered the administration of contested border areas between the north and south. It confirmed Southern Kordofan and the Blue Nile States as federal states of Sudan. The agreement established a power-sharing arrangement in their state legislatures, with 55% of seats controlled by the governing party of Sudan (NPC) and 45% of seats by the SPLM/A. However, this arrangement would only be in effect during the interim period. Afterward, elections would be held to establish a democratically elected government and assembly in these regions. Furthermore, the agreement did not grant any special standing to these states, unlike the Abyei area settlement. It also emphasized the need for joint agreement between conflict parties on a program for the resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons. The second agreement concluded in Naivasha on 26 May 2004 was the Protocol Between the SUDANESE GOVERNMENT and SPLM on the Resolution of Conflict in Abyei Area on 26 May 2004. The agreement established a temporary administrative arrangement for Abyei and emphasized that its final status should not be predetermined by this agreement. It required the redeployment of military forces from both the government of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan from the Abyei region. Instead, an Interim Security Force for Abyei (ISFA) composed of Ethiopian troops would be deployed in the area. The third agreement concluded in Naivasha on 26 May 2004 was the Protocol Between the SUDANESE GOVERNMENT and SPLM on Power Sharing on 26 May 2004. This peace agreement established an interim constitution and set up a Government of Southern Sudan for the interim period. During this period, the government would have a legislative assembly and executive powers. In the legislature, the SPLM/A would hold 70% of the seats, while the ruling Khartoum party (NCP) would have 15%, and other Southern Sudanese political forces would receive 15% of the seats. The same formula applied to the executive authority of Southern Sudan. At the national level, a power-sharing arrangement was agreed upon. John Garang, the leader of SPLM/A, was appointed as the first Vice-President. The National Assembly was formed with a formula of 52% of seats for the NCP and 28% of seats for the SPLM/A. Both the Southern Sudanese Government and the Sudanese Government were given the right to control their own police and security forces. They also agreed to work together in addressing the issue of resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons.

One of the most contentious issues that remained following the signing of the CPA was the status of Abyei. The protocol on Abeyi included in the CPA stipulated the formation of the Abyei Borders Commission (ABC), which was tasked to demarcate the borders of Abyei. It had been agreed that if the five representatives of the Sudanese government and the five representatives of the SPLM/A seated in the ABC could not agree on the location of the borders, five international experts would map the borders. These experts issued a decision on the borders of Abyei on 14 July 2005, but the Sudanese government immediately rejected this decision. In addition, as soon as the international experts of the ABC had issued their report, several minor violent clashes took place in Abyei between different tribal militias supported by each side. Later that month, on 30 July 2005, SPLM/A leader John Garang died in a helicopter crash.

On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected.

From the start of the seventh round of talks, the pressure on the conflict parties to sign a peace agreement steadily increased. The Western governments funding the peace process warned the parties that funding for the peace process could dry up in the absence of progress during the talks. The meetings of the seventh round of negotiations were held at different locations, but finished again in Abuja. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected. Instead, a number of high-profile diplomats arrived on 2 May 2006 in order to force a breakthrough in the negotiations. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hour extensions to the talks� deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US�s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N�djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee.

In his letter send to Salim on 10 May, Abdul Wahid proposed to conclude a �supplementary agreement� to the DPA, demanding greater representation at the legislature and executive bodies of Darfur, as well as a larger compensation fund for Darfur. However, Salim knew that the chief government negotiator, Majzoub El Khalifa, would reject this option, instead insisting that Abdul Wahid had to sign the DPA first, after which some of the remaining issues could be negotiated. Consequently, on 13 May 2006, Salim replied to Wahid that the AU could not re-open negotiations on the DPA, but was willing to support the conflict parties in implementing the agreement.

The leaders discussed the prospects for peace in Sudan, but also agreed to end support for the armed opposition in each other's countries. While there were some talks on ending military support to the armed opposition groups in Darfur, the SLM/A did not engage in peace talks with the government between 2007 and 2011 in spite of some joint UN/AU mediation effort. In February 2007, a joint UN/AU mediation effort was initiated, headed by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, who respectively represented the UN and the AU. The SLM/A faction led by Minni Minnawi lost power and the movement was now led by Abdul Wahid. The SLM/A refused to attend the UN/AU organised negotiations in Sirtre, Libya. Hence, they were not involved in any negotiations with the Government of Sudan in 2007, although the SLM/A leadership did consult with the UN/AU negotiation team. In the beginning of 2008, the joint UN/AU mediation effort continued. Yet, no substantial progress was made. As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassol� assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no real negotiations took place. Abdul Wahid, the leader of SLM/A, demanded that security had to be provided for the civilians in Darfur before he would enter negotiations. Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort in 2009. SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid refused to leave his exile in Paris. Consequently, no negotiations were held between the SPLM/A and the Government of Sudan in 2009. In 2010, Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort. In contrast to several of the other rebel groups based in Darfur, the SLM/A and its leader Abdul Wahid refused to negotiate with the Government of Sudan until the security situation in Darfur would improve.

This mediation effort was led by Qatarese Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. The agreement between Chad and Sudan concluded on 25 December 2009 was confirmed on 9 February 2010, when Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Sudan and met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. During the visit, Chad and Sudan signed a formal agreement in which they agreed that neither would support rebel organizations targeting the other. While there were some talks on ending military support to the armed opposition groups in Darfur, the SLM/A did not engage in peace talks with the government between 2007 and 2011 in spite of some joint UN/AU mediation effort. In February 2007, a joint UN/AU mediation effort was initiated, headed by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, who respectively represented the UN and the AU. The SLM/A faction led by Minni Minnawi lost power and the movement was now led by Abdul Wahid. The SLM/A refused to attend the UN/AU organised negotiations in Sirtre, Libya. Hence, they were not involved in any negotiations with the Government of Sudan in 2007, although the SLM/A leadership did consult with the UN/AU negotiation team. In the beginning of 2008, the joint UN/AU mediation effort continued. Yet, no substantial progress was made. As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassol� assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no real negotiations took place. Abdul Wahid, the leader of SLM/A, demanded that security had to be provided for the civilians in Darfur before he would enter negotiations. Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort in 2009. SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid refused to leave his exile in Paris. Consequently, no negotiations were held between the SPLM/A and the Government of Sudan in 2009. In 2010, Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort. In contrast to several of the other rebel groups based in Darfur, the SLM/A and its leader Abdul Wahid refused to negotiate with the Government of Sudan until the security situation in Darfur would improve. In November 2011, the SLM/A � together with the Sudan People�s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM/A-North), the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Minni Minnawi (SLM/A-MM) � formed a new rebel coalition: the Sudanese Revolutionary Army (SRF).

This round started in Abuja on 29 November 2005. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories, which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected. Instead, a number of high-profile diplomats arrived on 2 May 2006 in order to force a breakthrough in the negotiations. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hour extensions to the talks� deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US�s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N�djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee. Zoellick also threatened Minni Minawi with possible UN sanctions or an International Criminal Court indictment if he did not sign the agreement. In addition, Zoellick threatened that an attack on Minawi�s forces in South Darfur by Sudanese troops would be executed if he failed to sign the DPA. Despite these threats, Minawi still had reservations when the final stretch of the Abuja talks started on 4 May, which were hosted by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo at his state house in Abuja. During a break of the plenary peace talks on 4 May, Zoellick allegedly told Minawi privately, �Have no doubt where I stand. I am a good friend and I am a fearsome enemy.� Minawi signed the DPA the next day, on 5 May 2006. However, the JEM and the SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid refused to sign the agreement, leaving the SLM/A led by Minni Minnawi as the only rebel party that signed the peace agreement. The agreement included a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, reaffirming the N�Dajema Agreement of April 2004. It aimed to integrate the forces of SLM/A and JEM into Sudan's security institutions, with 4000 soldiers joining the armed forces, 1000 joining the police, and 3000 receiving professional and educational training for civilian reintegration. The agreement covered both political representation and the future status of Darfur. In the political aspect, it focused on power-sharing at the national and state levels, establishing the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority (TDRA), and ensuring fair representation of Darfurians in Sudanese affairs.

An informal round of peace talks was subsequently held in Addis Ababa from 16 to 18 December 2015. However, this round of talks did not lead to an agreement, as the parties disagreed about whether the SPLM/A-North should be allowed to keep its troops. The conflict parties and the mediation team agreed to resume discussions in January 2016. A government attack on the SPLM/A-North in Aroum on 23 January 2016 led SPLM/A-North officials to publicly question the government�s commitment to establishing peace. In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas. The SPLM/A-N insisted on a provision allowing humanitarian access through Asosa in Ethiopia, but the Sudanese government rejected such a provision. In March 2017, the SPLM/A-North split into two factions, resulting in several clashes. While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks. The split was a result of long-simmering ethnic and political�military tensions within the SPLM/A-North in Blue Nile. While the Uduk, Berta, and Burun had made up the majority of the SPLM/A�s 10th Division during war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government between 1983 and 2005, members of the Ingessana tribe assumed increasingly more power within the rebel group from 2012 onwards. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the non-Ingessana tribes. Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-North and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated. In March 2017, SPLM/A-North deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu publicly released a resignation letter. Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-North movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu�s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-North to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe. The Nuba Mountains Liberation Council (NMLC) subsequently passed resolutions that removed Arman as the SPLM/A-North�s lead negotiator with the AUHIP, as well as put the NMLC in power of both South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Moreover, many senior non-Ingessana leaders began to publicly voice support for al-Hilu and the NMLC. In April 2017, almost all of the non-Ingessana Blue Nile Liberation Council (BNLC) members declared their support for the NMLC decision to dismiss Arman as the SPLM/A-North AUHIP lead negotiator. Accordingly, although the deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu broke away from the rebel group led by chairman Malik Agar, the UCDP codes the SPLM/A-North led by Malik Agar (SPLM/A-N-MA) as the splinter faction because the dismissal of Agar was endorsed by the NMLC and most of the BNLC.",Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,1.0,2015,12.0,16.0,2015.0,12.0,18.0,1.0,0.0,1,"AU, Ethiopia",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

This announcement received widespread attention, since Kony and four of his deputies had been indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. At Juba, Machar was supported both by a mediation team within his vice-Presidential office and by a mediation group that included delegates of Pax Christi, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Switzerland provided a professional negotiator that assisted Machar during the talks, while Pax Christi provided the LRA delegates with training in negotiating. The Community of Sant�Egidio, who had been invited by the LRA, also attended the negotiations. UN representatives from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Political Affairs were also involved in the process to advice on issues related to the protection of internally displaced persons political aspects of the process respectively. The UN had initially been ambivalent regarding the Juba process being more supportive of the ICC position. Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, faulted the Sudanese and Ugandan government for agreeing to talks to those indicted, stating that �Those who are indicted have been indicted because they are responsible for mass murder of the worst possible kind, and so those who are indicted should go and face justice in The Hague.� However, the UN became increasingly involved in the process over time and in October statements were made saying that the world body was firmly behind the process. The UN subsequently contributed 4.8 million US Dollars to sponsor the peace talks. In addition, in early December UN Secretary-general Kofi Annan named former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano his special envoy for LRA-affected areas. Chissano was mandated to develop a cohesive policy approach among all external actors in the peace process and to liaise with the ICC on questions regarding the indicted leadership of LRA. Neither Kony nor his top commanders attended the talks at Juba. Instead, the LRA delegation consisted of 14 negotiators, who had been appointed by Kony. Almost all of these 14 negotiators were Acholis from the Diaspora. The negotiation teams at Juba soon managed to agree on the issues that needed to be addressed in order to resolve the armed conflict: the cessation of hostilities, comprehensive solutions addressing the underlying issues of the conflict, reconciliation and accountability, the conclusion of a formal ceasefire, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the fighters.

The agreement provided for the establishment of a domestic legal framework that would function as a substitute for the ICC prosecutions. This was complemented by alternative processes like traditional justice. Under the accord, rebel commanders accused of serious crimes were to face formal criminal and civil justice proceedings in courts, which could impose �alternative penalties and sanctions� to replace existing punitive measures.

First, the LRA�s second in command, Vincent Otti had died in October 2007. Second, on 22 January 2008, LRA leader Joseph Kony sacked the head of LRA�s negotiating delegation, Martin Ojul, together with three others, accusing them of making money from the peace talks. Nevertheless, the Juba talks resumed on 30 January 2008 with the two sides extending the ceasefire the day before. The LRA team was now led by David Matsanga. Riek Machar continued to act as the chief mediator. In addition to the third parties already present in 2007, the US, the EU, Canada and Norway joined the talks. The conflict parties reached agreement on a number of issues. On 22 February 2008, the Implementation protocol to the Agreement on Comprehensive Solutions was signed. The protocol laid out the framework for the implementation of the Agreement on Comprehensive Solutions signed on 2 May 2007. According to the accord, the armed forces and security agencies were required to ensure that their recruitment and composition reflected the ethnic diversity of Uganda. Additionally, the agreement mandated the creation of an �Equal Opportunities Commission� shortly after the Final Peace Agreement�s signing. The primary responsibility of this commission was to investigate any regional or ethnic disparities and imbalances in government departments and institutions� participation. Furthermore, the agreement made provisions for the establishment of a �diaspora desk� within the Foreign Ministry. The purpose of this desk was to facilitate the repatriation and return of Ugandans residing abroad to their home country. On 23 February 2008, the Agreement on a Permanent ceasefire was signed. This agreement provided for an immediate truce, which was set to take effect 24 hours after the Final Peace Agreement's signing. As per the terms of the accord, all forces belonging to the LRA were required to be stationed within the Ri-Kwang-Ba assembly area, and a buffer zone surrounding it was to be respected. To monitor the cessation of hostilities, the existing Cessation of Hostilities Monitoring Team underwent transformation into a Ceasefire Monitoring Team. This new team consisted of five representatives from each of the parties involved in the agreement, five members from each of the AU observer countries participating in the peace talks, and a five-person liaison team from the UN. Additionally, it was specified that the Ceasefire Monitoring Team would be led by two senior officers from the SPLA. This arrangement aimed to ensure effective oversight and implementation of the ceasefire provisions outlined in the agreement. On 28 February 2008, the Agreement on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration was signed. This agreement established the Ceasefire Monitoring Team, which was created under the Agreement on a Permanent Ceasefire, with the primary responsibility of overseeing the disarmament and demobilization process. The accord specified that the Ceasefire Monitoring Team would develop a Disarmament Operations Plan, outlining the establishment of disarmament sites, among other details. Moreover, the Ceasefire Monitoring Team took on the task of facilitating the repatriation of ex-fighters from Ri-Kwan-Ba back to Uganda. The Government of Uganda was entrusted with the duty of identifying and preparing reception points for these returning individuals. Furthermore, the agreement granted former fighters the right to make a choice between joining the army or receiving reintegration support aimed at assisting them in their transition to civilian life. This provision aimed to offer these individuals the opportunity to pursue a path that best suited their aspirations and reintegration needs after leaving the armed forces. On 29 February 2008, the conflict parties signed the Agreement on Implementation and Monitoring Mechanisms. This agreement confirmed all the previous accords signed in the Juba process. It called for a transitional period of one month, commencing immediately after the Final Peace Agreement's signing, during which the Government of Uganda and the LRA were to prepare for the implementation of the Final Peace Agreement. As part of the accord, the parties agreed to develop an Implementation Schedule, which would be appended to the Final Peace Agreement, outlining all pertinent dates and timeframes for various actions and measures. Additionally, the Agreement on Implementation and Monitoring Mechanisms established an �Oversight Forum� responsible for overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the Final Peace Agreement. The forum would also offer advice and support to the parties and any relevant institutions created under the Final Peace Agreement. The Chief Mediator of the Juba process, Riek Machar, was designated as the chair of this forum, while the UN Secretary-General�s Special Envoy for LRA-affected areas, Joaquim Chissano, assumed the role of its spokesperson.

However, Kony did not show up, stating he wanted clarification on the issues of the Mato Oput (traditional judicial system) and the Special Division of the High Court.

While the LRA continued to request further mediated negotiations, Uganda�s president Museveni stated in July 2008 that his government would not hold further negotiations with Kony. Instead, the Government of Uganda would wait for Kony to sign the Final Peace Agreement. On 11 September 2008, Machar declared the peace process over. Another signing ceremony was prepared in November 2008, but Kony again failed to show up. The LRA called for a ceasefire in January, March, and June 2009. However, the LRA was only willing to resume peace talks provided that another mediator would lead the process and that talks would be held at another venue. In October 2009, Matsanga stated that talks should be held on �neutral ground� such as in Kenya or Tanzania.

In October 1997, the ADF sent a list of preconditions for peace talks to President Museveni. These included power-sharing with the rebel groups, suspension of the country�s 1995 constitution that bans all political parties, and the release of all captured rebels. The Ugandan government did not respond to these demands.

This allowed the conflict parties to focus on the remaining key issues, which were the formulation of a unified national army, the setting of dates for a ceasefire and multiparty elections, and the international monitoring of implementation of an agreement. Of these remaining issues, the election date proved to be the most contentious point. While the MPLA government demanded the election to be held three years after the ceasefire date, UNITA proposed the elections to be held as early as nine months after the ceasefire. It was only after the US and the Soviet Union agreed to take part in the implementation process of the agreement that the conflict parties agreed to the elections taking place 18 months after the ceasefire would take effect, which was set for 15 May 1991. On 31 May 1991, the Bicesse Agreement was signed. The agreement established a ceasefire to be monitored by a joint commission, comprised of the two warring parties and a number of third parties. Furthermore, the agreement stipulated reforms of the military and security sector, creating an integrated army and a new police force. The agreement stipulated that both parties would contribute 20000 troops each to the new armed forces. The forces that were not integrated into the new army were to be demobilized and reintegrated into civilian life. The agreement allowed UNITA to become a legal political party. The agreement committed the parties to a multi-party democracy. An elections process was to be held in which the people would vote for a new President and a National Assembly. Political rights were extended, such as the freedom of expression and freedom of association. The authority of the central administration was extended to include the entire Angolan territory. The implementation of the peace agreement became the responsibility of the joint political-military commission. All civilian and military prisoners were to be released as a consequence of the agreement. The question of the return of exiles was to be discussed in the joint political-military commission. A variety of different mediation methods were used by the third parties to move the conflict parties towards the Bicesse Accords. First, the Bush administration made negotiations more attractive to the MPLA Government by promising that if the conflict parties would reach a negotiated settlement, then Washington would normalise relations with the MPLA Government and recognise it. Second, the third parties used military inducements, both through extending and refusing to extend military assistance. Seeking to maintain their position in Southern Africa, the US had been supporting UNITA, while the Soviet Union had been supporting the MPLA government. However, as the Cold War waned by the end of the 1980s, the conflict parties could no longer depend on unqualified support from their clients. Besides scaling back their support, both Washington and Moscow became increasingly willing to apply pressure to the conflict parties in favour of a peaceful solution to the conflict. The US drew on its patron client relationship with UNITA by urging the latter to make public statements calling for national reconciliation, making it easier for the MPLA government to reach out. The US had also tacitly assured dos Santos that with national reconciliation, the military aid to UNITA would be ended. In addition, the third parties guaranteed the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. The agreement stipulated that representatives of Portugal, the USA and the USSR, together with sub-groups and members of the government and UNITA, were to take part in the joint Politico-Military Commission (CCPM), with the task of overseeing the political and ceasefire process. It was also agreed that around 30 observer states would be involved in the implementation process, as well as a UN force of 800 people financed by a US grant of 40 million US Dollars. Moreover, President dos Santos was promised by US Secretary of State James Baker that �the USA had all the means to guarantee the implementation of the accords and also to prevent the accords being violated.�",unknwon,unknwon,3.0,1991,4.0,4.0,1991.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,1,"Portugal, US, Russia (Soviet Union)",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,Bicesse Agreement,1991.0,5.0,31.0,0.0,

The agreement reinstated the ceasefire from 1991, but contained some important amendments. Among other things this ceasefire agreement included the withdrawal of UNITA forces from specific locations to allow for a UN monitoring and verification presence in these areas. UNITA forces would withdraw to encampment areas, while government forces, in turn, would remain �in situ�. The agreement stipulated a proportionate integration of UNITA forces into the new national army.

A new schedule was agreed for the implementation of the accord, stipulating that the terms of the protocol was to be fulfilled by 28 February. However, this failed to materialise. Since this deadline was yet again not met, the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on UNITA on 25 June 1998, which stipulated the freezing of UNITA�s foreign bank accounts and a ban on the purchase of Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin, as well as prohibited all air and water transport in and out of the territories controlled by UNITA. Savimbi had indicated on 6 June 1998 that if the UN would impose new sanctions, UNITA would regard this as an attack on UNITA to which it was ready to respond. Indeed, following the imposition of new UN sanctions, UNITA immediately seized control in some of the localities in which it had transferred power to the central government. By the end of 1998, the Government of Angola had lost patience with the lack of implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and resumed the civil war.

The IGAD mediation team warned the Somali leaders that �spoilers and those who obstruct the process from within and outside SNRP [Somali National Reconciliation Process] will be named publicly and subject to targeted international sanctions.� A few days later, the AU also declared that targeted sanctions would be imposed against the Somali leaders who did not participate in the process. On 22 August 2004, the first 194 members of the Transitional Parliament were sworn in at the UN complex in Nairobi. During the nomination period, the breakaway leaders had returned to participate in the negotiations, as preparations were made for the election of a president. On 14 October 2004, the Transitional Parliament elected Abdullahi Yusuf as interim president.

Prior to these talks, Abacha had held private consultations with NPFL leader Taylor for four days, which had led to a rapprochement between Nigeria and the NPFL. With Nigeria no long opposing his ambitions, Taylor became more amenable to a political solution to the conflict. A peace agreement was concluded in Abuja on 19 August 1995. The Abuja Accord managed to bring the leaders of all warring factions into the transitional government, which was installed on September 1995.

These negotiations took place within the framework of the ECOWAS Peace Process for Liberia and were mediated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar, the former Head of State of Nigeria. Throughout the negotiations, chief mediator Abubakar employed a mediation strategy aimed at facilitating consensus among the conflict parties. However, the negotiations were simultaneously influenced by pressure from external actors. Arguably the most external influence came from an indictment against Charles Taylor. Just as the negotiations were to begin, on 4 June 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was established by the UN Security Council, issued an indictment against Charles Taylor for complicity in crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone. Consequently, Ghana had to decide whether to hand over Taylor or not. Many of the participants commented on the possible removal of Taylor as being in violation with African hospitality. Indeed, in line with earlier statements on the absolute safety of all participants in the negotiations, the Government of Ghana refused to turn over Taylor. Nonetheless, later that same day, Charles Taylor left Accra and went back to Monrovia, while negotiations would continue according to schedule. Although Charles Taylor stayed in close contact with the representatives of the Government of Liberia present in Accra, his departure had a profound effect on the dynamics of the negotiations. Before the indictment of Taylor, the prospect for the conclusion of a peace agreement seemed bleak. Most participants of the negotiations believed President Taylor would never give up his presidency, while the rebel parties would never compromise on their main demand of Taylor�s immediate removal. These insurmountable positions remained relevant when Taylor left Accra, as he still had no intention of giving up the presidency. However, the indictment resulted in Taylor losing any last support from international partners and de-legitimatized him.

As a result of the defeat of UNITA, the Angolan government redirected at least 30,000 troops to Cabinda and started a large-scale offensive in October 2002. The government forces managed to destroy the main bases of both FLEC-FAC and FLEC-R by the end of 2002. The Angolan government simultaneously offered negotiations without accepting the separatist�s demands for a referendum on the legal status of Cabinda in October 2002. Simultaneously to the government offensive, FLEC-FAC and the Government of Angola met in Paris for official negotiations in February 2003. The government delegation proposed that in return for Cabinda remaining an integral part of Angola, it would increase its budget for the enclave and promised to integrate FLEC-FAC fighters into the armed forces. The FLEC-FAC rejected this proposal, allegedly because the government had promised the same to FLEC-R. In 2004, the FLEC-R and the FLEC-FAC announced a unified FLEC, but this unification already broke down in 2005 because of a disagreement on entering into negotiations. While the FLEC-FAC opposed peace talks, the FLEC-R was open to the possibility of entering negotiations. Following the collapse of the united front, former FLEC�R leader Ant�nio Bento Bembe negotiated with the government, and a peace agreement was signed on 1 August 2006, but the FLEC-FAC continued to fight the government.

The main issue that was agreed upon within this peace agreement revolved around changing the political and territorial setup of the Comoros. This involved granting significant self-governing powers to the various islands that make up this small country. However, the final structure of the political system was somewhat unclear, as it contained elements of federal, confederal, and autonomy-based solutions. It was explicitly mentioned that the central government would retain responsibility for matters such as external defense, religion, nationality, monetary policy, and foreign relations. Nevertheless, the specific powers to be delegated to the islands remained uncertain. Additionally, as part of the agreement, a new constitution was to be drafted and put to a referendum after a one-year transitional period. No third party had been involved in the negotiations leading up to this agreement. However, the agreement was severely criticized by the OAU on the grounds that it contravened the Antananarivo Agreement from 1999. Additionally, the opposition on both Anjouan and Moroni strongly criticized the agreement for excluding a great majority of the Comorian people and political shareholders.

Madeira, the Special Envoy on Comoros of the OAU Secretary-General, and Andr� Salifou, the Special envoy on Comoros of la Francophonie and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Niger, acted as the joint chief mediators. The peace talks led to the signing of the Famboni II Agreement on 17 February 2001. The agreement officially reinstated the Comoros as a federal entity. It outlined the requirement for the islands to adopt a new constitution that would clarify their relationship with the central government. This new constitution was scheduled to be submitted to a referendum before the end of June. Once the constitutional referendum took place, a transitional government of national unity would be established. Their responsibilities would include creating new institutions, organizing elections, and transferring power to civilian authorities by 31 December 2001. The existing regimes in Moheli and Anjouan would continue until the June referendum, but any members of these regimes intending to run for election would need to resign one week before the publication of the referendum results. Subsequently, a new transitional government would be formed to oversee the establishment of the new institutions. Finally, presidential and general elections were slated to be held in December 2001. However, the implementation of the accord was fraught with difficulties. Consequently, negotiations regarding the new constitution continued. In addition, three coup attempts took place, of which one was successful. In a coup taking place on 8 and 9 August 2001, Anjouan President Said Abeid Abd�r�mane was removed from power and replaced by a collective military presidency, which appointed a government consisting of eight civilian commissioners. The new leaders committed themselves to the Famboni II agreement, which improved the prospects of successful implementation. The new constitution was finally approved in a referendum in December 2001.

Gabon�s efforts to resolve the conflict were aided by the International Negotiation Network (INN), which had been involved consultations with the conflict parties since August 1999, when Professor William Zartman and Joyce Neu had travelled to Brazzaville. On the basis of these consultations, the representatives of the INN drafted an eight-point document outlining a framework for a transition to free and fair elections. Although the INN launched its mediation attempt separately from Omar Bongo�s efforts, President Sassou-Nguessou made it clear that he would only accept mediation by the INN if they would coordinate with Bongo. Peace talks mediated by Bongo opened in Libreville on 18 December 1999. During the negotiations, Bongo built on the eight-point document that had been produced by the INN. The peace talks led to the signing of the Accord de Cessez-le-Feu et de Cessation des Hostilit�s in Brazzaville on 29 December 1999. This agreement stipulates an immediate ceasefire and the creation of a committee to implement the accord. This committee was tasked to oversee the disarmament of the militias, the integration of former fighters into the armed forces, and collection of weapons from these groups. The accord also guaranteed the free circulation of people and their goods throughout the country and allowed for former civil servants to resume their posts.

This committee would include representatives of France, the EU, the AU, ECOWAS, the UN, la Francophonie, the IMF, the World Bank, and the G8.

The composition of this government would involve individuals selected by the participating parties during the Round Table discussions. To ensure credible and transparent elections, the agreement requires the preparation of an electoral timetable. Additionally, upon assuming office, the Government of National Reconciliation would immediately commence the process of regrouping its forces under the supervision of French and ECOWAS authorities. Subsequently, steps would be taken to disarm and demobilize all forces involved in the conflict.

Hence, the negotiations first focused on the conclusion of a ceasefire. The conflict parties signed a ceasefire on 23 January 2014, which took effect the next day. The ceasefire committed the conflict parties to end offensive operations, freeze their forces in place, and refrain from attacks against civilians. The ceasefire also established a monitoring and verification mechanism.",Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,1.0,2014,1.0,2.0,2014.0,1.0,31.0,1.0,0.0,1,"IGAD, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Sudan",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,ceasefire,2014.0,1.0,23.0,0.0,

The agreement also specified that the SPLM/A-IO was allowed to deploy 1,410 security personnel in Juba and the government could deploy 3,420 security personnel. The ARCSS included a political power-sharing provision. To this purpose, Machar returned to Juba in April 2016. However, problems with the implementation of the ARCSS were already apparent prior to Machar�s return. Kiir had cast aside the power-sharing formula of the ARCSS in October 2015 by creating 28 states instead of ten states. In addition, in violation to the agreement, Chief of Staff Paul Malong had secretly brought a Dinka militia to Juba.

During this conference, a meeting was held between the CNDP, PARECO, the Government of the DRC, and the Government of Rwanda at the Ihusi Hotel in Goma on 16 January 2008. Although the UN representatives participated in the conference, the two chief mediators were Abb� Appollinaire Malu Malu and Vital Kamerhe. These two Congolese politicians had been mandated to mediate by the Government. Prior to the actual conference the chief mediators went on an extensive awareness-raising tour through North and South Kivu. On the basis of different consultations and meetings during this tour, they drafted a document specifying 15 objectives of the conference. While the organizers of the conference expected 600 participants, around 1500 people showed up at Goma at the start of the conference on 6 January 2008. The role of the UN representatives was twofold. First, the served as observers in order to ensure the neutrality of the talks. Second, in addition to participating in the plenary meetings, the UN representatives held secret bilateral meetings with Government of the DRC and the CNDP leadership. This led to PARECO ending its conflict with the CNDP on 17 January and the conclusion of a peace agreement between CNDP and the Government of the DRC on 23 January.

Wamba�s power in the RCD-ML was being questioned by RCD-ML�s prime minister and member of an influential Nande family in North Kivu, Mbusa Nyamwisi and RCD-ML�s minister of mining, finance and budget and former head of the Kilo Moto gold mines in Ituri, John Tibasima, himself from Ituri and the Hema ethnic community. Their forces clashed in Ituri and ended with Wamba�s evacuation by the Ugandans in November 2000. This led to a lack of leadership in Ituri and a militarization of the communal conflict. Both Nyamwisi and Tibasima had trained and recruited soldiers for the RCD-ML from both Lendu and Hema communities and provided them with arms and training. With the lack of leadership, these soldiers now dispersed in their communities, which led to an intensification of the conflict between Hema and Lendu towards the end of 2000. A second round of heavy fighting erupted at the beginning of 2001. Lendu militias attacked Bunia for the first time, especially targeting UPDF headquarters and the airport.

With President Salva Kiir in power, many Nuer felt marginalized. Nuer and Dinka representatives attended a two-day peace conference in Unity State capital Bentiu on 11 and 12 September 2012. County commissioners and chiefs from Unity State attended the meeting, which focused on preventing cattle raiding in Unity State. The meeting ended with a vow to work towards establishing better relations between the different communities in Unity State. The conference was funded by USAID. Fighting between the Dinka and the Nuer escalated in the context of the civil war between Sudan People�s Liberation Movement/Army - In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and the Government of South Sudan that started in mid-December 2013, when two different factions within the Presidential guard clashed in Juba. One faction was loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, while the other faction was loyal to the former vice-president Riek Machar, a Nuer. Machar had been ousted from the government in July 2013. In mid-December 2013, President Kiir accused Riek Machar of conducting a coup d��tat, but this accusation later proved to be unsubstantiated. The accusation is widely seen as a pretext for crack down on Machar and pushing all Nuer troops out of Juba, after which Nuer civilians were targeted. Hilde Johnson, the UN Special Representative to the Secretary-General in South Sudan at the time, notes how what �clearly had been at first a fight between forces of the Presidential Guard loyal to the President and those siding with Riek Machar had degenerated into a deliberate massacre of Nuer, particularly Nuer males.� Armed clashes between government forces and the SPLM/A-IO quickly spread to other areas, in particular to Bor, Malakal, and Bentiu.

4857,5467,3,Sudan,625,SPLM/A,SSDF,5467-8,"On 10 February 1995, Riek Machar announced that in pursuit of reconciliation with the SPLM/A, the SPLM/A-united issued a unilateral ceasefire. Machar further stated that a National Reconciliation and Peace Committee set up in 1994 would continue to work towards concluding a non-aggression pact between the SPLM/A and the SPLM/A-united. While there had been no fighting between Sudanese government forces and the SSDF, the SSDF announced a unilateral ceasefire on 12 March 1996, which the Sudanese government reciprocated. The SSDF and the government signed a ceasefire on 12 March 1996. This ceasefire paved the way for the conclusion of the Khartoum Agreement on 21 April 1997. This agreement turned Machar�s fighters essentially into a pro-government militia and the group changed its name to South Sudan Defence Force (SSDF). The SSDF received extensive support from the Sudanese government. The SSDF guarded the oil-rich territories under its control, as well as conducted attacks on the SPLM/A in areas controlled by the SPLM/A. While the conflict parties repeatedly clashed throughout 1997, there were relatively few clashes in 1998. One reason for this is that there was heavy fighting between rival factions within the SSDF. Riek Machar had proposed a different candidate than Paulino Matip for the gubernatorial elections in Unity State in December 1997. Since Matip�s forces were in control of most the oil-rich territory in Unity state, he saw losing political power in Unity as a significant threat to his business interests. This triggered Paulino Matip to try and remove Riek Machar from power and assume the leadership of the SSDF. Since this attempt was unsuccessful, Matip decided to create the South Sudan Unity Movement/Army (SSUM/A) and continue to fight the SSDF. The Sudanese government supported Matip and his SSUM/A fighters, allowing the SSUM/A to advance deep into Western upper Nile to clear the area for oil exploration. The SSUM/A gained the upper hand on the battlefield by late 1998. This led to a sidelining of Machar within the SSDF. Machar and forces loyal to him were excluded from the SSDF, after which Paulino Matip was taken back in as the Commander in Chief of the SSDF.",unknown,Sudan,2.0,1995,,,1995.0,,,3.0,0.0,1,local peace committee,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,

This somewhat reduced tensions between the Dinka dominated SPLM/A and the Nuer dominated SSDF. Crucially, the Sudanese government terminated its support to the SSDF in late 1999. In addition, many political leaders among the SSDF became increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of the Khartoum agreement between the Sudanese government and the SSDF which had been concluded in 1997. These changing circumstances explain why some leaders of the SSDF and the SPLM/A in the Upper Nile decided to build on the peace conference in Wunlit and initiate a peace meeting between the SSDF, the SPLM/A, and Simon Gatwec�s militia in Akobo on 18 August 1999.

This changed when, in 1983, the Sudanese government reneged on the Addis Abba Agreement that had been concluded in 1972. Contrary to this agreement, the Sudanese government divided southern Sudan into three different regions. The Dinka opposed this change, whereas the Mundari supported it. This worsened the relationship between the two ethnic groups. Tensions increased even more when the second civil war started in 1983. In 1986, the civil war reached the Mundari area and some Mundari militias began to fight alongside government forces. Yet, some Mundari fighters also fought under the banner of the SPLM/A from the late 1980s onwards and throughout the rest of the war. Tensions between the two groups remained following the end of the civil war with the conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005, particularly because of land conflicts and grievances among the Mundari leadership that they were excluded from power on the national level. This has led to occasional clashes between the Bor Dinka and Mundari in the Central Equatoria State in the post-CPA period, including after South Sudan gained independence in July 2011.
