To this purpose, he turned to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for help.

Ansarallah and al-Hirak refused to take part and did not endorse the resulting agreement. The initiative, backed by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council and the European Union, ended President Ali Abdullah Saleh�s thirty-three-year term, and placed Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, his then deputy, as interim president.

This was the first nationwide truce since 2016 and also contained agreements to allow two commercial flights into Sana?a airport each week, to open Hodeidah port to 18 fuel ships, and to begin discussions on opening blocked roads in Taiz. On 7 April 2022, ousted but internationally recognized President Hadi handed over his powers to a presidential council formed of eight members composed of both political and armed group leaders, which would be responsible for implementing the truce. The eight-man Presidential Leadership Council was formally sworn in on 19 April in Aden. Although this nationwide truce and the government reshuffle came as a surprise to even long-time Yemen analyst, some factors contributed to this outcome. Firstly, the Saudi-led coalition increasingly recognised that a military victory was unlikely, as Houthis missile and drone attacks on Saudi and Emirati territory increased, posing economic risks, and damaging the international reputations of these Gulf states. Secondly, President Biden's shift in US policy towards the coalition, ending ""offensive"" support, prompted the US to support UN-led negotiations. This combination of pressure and diplomatic engagement encouraged Saudi and Emirati leadership to seek an end to their involvement in the war. The appointment of the new UN special envoy, Hans Grundberg, also injected new life into the stalled UN process. Furthermore, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may view their disengagement from Yemen as part of a broader effort to establish a more functional relationship with Iran amidst the ongoing nuclear deal negotiations.

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the charter of national reconciliation proposed by the Arab League tripartite committee. Among the attendees, there were 32 Christian legislators and 30 Muslim legislators. The talks were mediated by Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco, with the assistance of Lakhdar Brahimi, the Arab League's assistant Secretary-General. During the negotiations, Saudi Arabia reportedly provided financial incentives to encourage the parties involved in the peace process. Notably absent from the discussions were General Michel Aoun, who was advising the Christian parliamentarians from Beirut, as well as the leader of the Druze community, the leader of the Druze militia, and the leaders of the two major Shi'ite militias, Amal and Hezbollah. Additionally, the four external powers operating on Lebanese soil � Syria, Israel, Iran, and the Palestinians (both PLO and non-PLO) � were not present. The negotiations focused on three major issues: political reforms based on the Constitutional Document of 1976, the election of a new president, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory. The latter issue proved to be the most contentious and divisive. The meeting experienced a deadlock as Christian parliamentarians continued to insist on a specific commitment for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, with General Aoun advocating for an accelerated timetable. The Arab League committee finally proposed an amended plan on 21 October that stipulated that the Syrian and the Lebanese governments would decide �together� on Syrian troops redeployment, while the original plan stated that Syria would make this decision �in coordination� with Lebanon. The meeting held in Taif, Saudi Arabia, extended over a period of 23 days, culminating in the agreement known as the Taif Agreement on 22 October 1989. During the final vote, 59 deputies expressed their support for the agreement, one voted against it, and two chose to abstain. However, General Michel Aoun vehemently rejected the Taif agreement. His primary objection stemmed from the absence of a firm commitment to ensure the swift and complete withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, which he saw as a threat to Lebanon's sovereignty. Aoun further contended that the proposed political reforms within the agreement were inadequate, failing to address the fundamental political problems at hand and, therefore, deemed them unacceptable.",tarif,Saudi Arabia,1.0,1989,9.0,30.0,1989.0,10.0,22.0,1.0,0.0,1,"Arab League, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, marocco",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Government-Related,Governance,Other

The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the charter of national reconciliation proposed by the Arab League tripartite committee. Among the attendees, there were 32 Christian legislators and 30 Muslim legislators. The talks were mediated by Saudi Arabia, Algeria, and Morocco, with the assistance of Lakhdar Brahimi, the Arab League�s assistant Secretary-General. During the negotiations, Saudi Arabia reportedly provided financial incentives to encourage the parties involved in the peace process. Notably absent from the discussions were General Michel Aoun, who was advising the Christian parliamentarians from Beirut, as well as the leader of the Druze community, the leader of the Druze militia, and the leaders of the two major Shi'ite militias, Amal and Hezbollah. Additionally, the four external powers operating on Lebanese soil � Syria, Israel, Iran, and the Palestinians (both PLO and non-PLO) � were not present. The negotiations focused on three major issues: political reforms based on the Constitutional Document of 1976, the election of a new president, and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanese territory. The latter issue proved to be the most contentious and divisive. The meeting experienced a deadlock as Christian parliamentarians continued to insist on a specific commitment for the withdrawal of Syrian troops from Lebanon, with General Aoun advocating for an accelerated timetable. The Arab League committee finally proposed an amended plan on 21 October 1989 that stipulated that the Syrian and the Lebanese governments would decide �together� on Syrian troops redeployment, while the original plan stated that Syria would make this decision �in coordination� with Lebanon.

During the final vote, 59 deputies expressed their support for the agreement, one voted against it, and two chose to abstain. However, General Michel Aoun vehemently rejected the Taif agreement. His primary objection stemmed from the absence of a firm commitment to ensure the swift and complete withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon, which he saw as a threat to Lebanon�s sovereignty. Aoun further contended that the proposed political reforms within the agreement were inadequate, failing to address the fundamental political problems at hand and, therefore, deemed them unacceptable.",tarif,Saudi Arabia,1.0,1989,9.0,30.0,,,,,0.0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Other,Other,Other

Additionally, it included an amnesty provision, granting immunity to all rebel groups except those involved in acts of genocide. Furthermore, the peace agreement provided a roadmap for an Inter-Congolese Dialogue, which aimed at achieving a democratic transition through general elections. Participants in this dialogue would include the government, armed groups, as well as unarmed political forces within the country. The MLC signed the agreement on 1 August 1999. On 31 August, after intense diplomatic pressure, all 50 founding members of the fractious RCD signed. Rebel leader Emile Ilunga and 41 of his deputies signed on behalf of the RCD. This was a compromise following dispute between the two RCD factions about which group had the right to sign.

This meeting led to the signing of the Lusaka Accord by the regional states on 10 July 1999, but RCD and MLC initially refuse to sign. The agreement outlined several key provisions to bring about peace. It called for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the halt of military movements, and the cessation of hostile propaganda. A crucial aspect was the complete withdrawal of foreign troops from the territory of the DRC within a nine-month timeframe. To ensure compliance with the ceasefire and the disarmament of militia groups, a joint military commission, consisting of the warring parties and a UN/OAU observer group, would be established. The agreement also entailed the deployment of UN peacekeepers and the formation of a national army comprising both government and rebel forces. Additionally, it included an amnesty provision, granting immunity to all rebel groups except those involved in acts of genocide. Furthermore, the peace agreement provided a roadmap for an Inter-Congolese Dialogue, which aimed at achieving a democratic transition through general elections. Participants in this dialogue would include the government, armed groups, as well as unarmed political forces within the country. The MLC signed the agreement on 1 August 1999.

Firstly, it established a ceasefire and required all troops to either remain in their current positions or be stationed in designated sites, where they would await demobilization or integration into the new armed forces. To monitor and supervise the ceasefire, a joint ceasefire commission was established, consisting of government delegates, representatives from the warring parties, as well as members from the UN, the OAU, and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi. The parties also agreed on the reform of the armed forces, with a 50-50 ethnic quota, ensuring equal representation of Hutus and Tutsis.

Firstly, it established a ceasefire and required all troops to either remain in their current positions or be stationed in designated sites, where they would await demobilization or integration into the new armed forces. To monitor and supervise the ceasefire, a joint ceasefire commission was established, consisting of government delegates, representatives from the warring parties, as well as members from the UN, the OAU, and the Regional Peace Initiative for Burundi. The parties also agreed on the reform of the armed forces, with a 50-50 ethnic quota, ensuring equal representation of Hutus and Tutsis.

Nqakula was mandated by South African President Thabo Mbeki, following a request from the leadership of the East African region of the African Union for South Africa to continue with mediation efforts in Burundi. On 18 June 2006, the parties signed the Dar-Es- Salaam Agreement of Principles Towards Lasting Peace, Security and Stability in Burundi, in which the parties agreed on a two-week ceasefire to negotiate a permanent ceasefire. More specifically, the agreement included provisions to address various aspects of the conflict and promote reconciliation. Firstly, it granted provisional immunity to members of Palipehutu-FNL, ensuring their protection from prosecution. Additionally, the agreement called for the release of political prisoners and prisoners of war. Palipehutu-FNL was permitted to transition into a political party, but only after separating its political and military branches. This separation aimed to establish a clear distinction between the movement�s political activities and armed operations. To facilitate healing and societal reconciliation, a Truth, Forgiveness, and Reconciliation Commission was to be established.

Similarly, Zaire and Egypt mediated in 1990, but could not bring the conflict parties to the negotiation table. The Government of Sudan took the initiative in March 1990 to request the US to mediate. The US subsequently initiated a mediation effort. In order to move the conflict parties towards a peace settlement, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen began to shuttle between the conflict parties in March 1990. Cohen formulated a proposal that stipulated the conclusion of a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, followed by a constitutional conference that would decide on a federal system. With regard to the withdrawal of troops, Cohen proposed the complete evacuation of the national army to positions north of the 11th parallel, while the SPLM/A had to guarantee that it would not take control of southern Sudan militarily if the government forces would withdraw. With neither conflict party agreeing to this proposal, Cohen subsequently formulated a new proposal, which stipulated that half of the government forces would be pulled out from southern Sudan, while the SPLM/A would in exchange withdraw all its troops 15 kilometres from the besieged towns. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops would be internationally monitored. Cohen also proposed to hold a constitutional conference. Cohen personally presented the adapted proposal to President al-Bashir in Khartoum on 9 March 1990. While al-Bashir promised Cohen to study the proposal carefully, he soon conveyed that he rejected the possibility of a constitutional conference, preferring bilateral talks with John Garrang.

The first agreement was the Protocol Between the SUDANESE GOVERNMENT and SPLM on the Resolution of Conflict in Southern Kordofan/Nuba Mountains and Blue Nile States on 26 May 2004. This agreement covered the administration of contested border areas between the north and south. It confirmed Southern Kordofan and the Blue Nile States as federal states of Sudan. The agreement established a power-sharing arrangement in their state legislatures, with 55% of seats controlled by the governing party of Sudan (NPC) and 45% of seats by the SPLM/A. However, this arrangement would only be in effect during the interim period. Afterward, elections would be held to establish a democratically elected government and assembly in these regions. Furthermore, the agreement did not grant any special standing to these states, unlike the Abyei area settlement. It also emphasized the need for joint agreement between conflict parties on a program for the resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons. The second agreement concluded in Naivasha on 26 May 2004 was the Protocol Between the SUDANESE GOVERNMENT and SPLM on the Resolution of Conflict in Abyei Area on 26 May 2004. The agreement established a temporary administrative arrangement for Abyei and emphasized that its final status should not be predetermined by this agreement. It required the redeployment of military forces from both the government of Sudan and the Republic of South Sudan from the Abyei region. Instead, an Interim Security Force for Abyei (ISFA) composed of Ethiopian troops would be deployed in the area. The third agreement concluded in Naivasha on 26 May 2004 was the Protocol Between the SUDANESE GOVERNMENT and SPLM on Power Sharing on 26 May 2004. This peace agreement established an interim constitution and set up a Government of Southern Sudan for the interim period. During this period, the government would have a legislative assembly and executive powers. In the legislature, the SPLM/A would hold 70% of the seats, while the ruling Khartoum party (NCP) would have 15%, and other Southern Sudanese political forces would receive 15% of the seats. The same formula applied to the executive authority of Southern Sudan. At the national level, a power-sharing arrangement was agreed upon. John Garang, the leader of SPLM/A, was appointed as the first Vice-President. The National Assembly was formed with a formula of 52% of seats for the NCP and 28% of seats for the SPLM/A. Both the Southern Sudanese Government and the Sudanese Government were given the right to control their own police and security forces. They also agreed to work together in addressing the issue of resettlement of refugees and internally displaced persons. The conclusion of the three agreements concluded in Naivasha on 26 May 2004 finalised the political negotiations.

309,663,2,Sudan,625,Government of Sudan,SPLM/A,663-66,"The Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed in Naivasha on 9 January 2005. The agreement stipulated that the south would have autonomy for an interim period of 6 years, followed by a referendum in 2011 offering the option of independence from Sudan. John Garang, the leader of SPLM/A, would become the First Vice President, and SPLM/A would hold 28 percent of the seats in the National Government. The application of Sharia law was limited to the north and only to Muslims. Oil revenues in the south were specified to be shared equally (50-50) between the north and the south. The forces of the National Government and SPLM/A were to remain separate, but integrated units of 21,000 troops were to be formed. The government was required to withdraw 91,000 troops from the south within two and a half years, while the SPLM/A would have eight months to withdraw its troops from the north. Finally, the north and the south would have separate banking systems and currencies. The Government of National Unity � consisting of members of the National Congress Party (NCP), the SPLM/A, and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) � was formed on 22 September 2005. One of the most contentious issues that remained following the signing of the CPA was the status of Abyei. The protocol on Abeyi included in the CPA stipulated the formation of the Abyei Borders Commission (ABC), which was tasked to demarcate the borders of Abyei. It had been agreed that if the five representatives of the Sudanese government and the five representatives of the SPLM/A seated in the ABC could not agree on the location of the borders, five international experts would map the borders. These experts issued a decision on the borders of Abyei on 14 July 2005, but the Sudanese government immediately rejected this decision. In addition, as soon as the international experts of the ABC had issued their report, several minor violent clashes took place in Abyei between different tribal militias supported by each side. Later that month, on 30 July 2005, SPLM/A leader John Garang died in a helicopter crash.

This plan was welcomed by the NDA as the best comprehensive political solution to the civil war. The Government of Sudan also approved of the five-point plan.

From the start of the seventh round of talks, the pressure on the conflict parties to sign a peace agreement steadily increased. The Western governments funding the peace process warned the parties that funding for the peace process could dry up in the absence of progress during the talks. The meetings of the seventh round of negotiations were held at different locations, but finished again in Abuja. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected. Instead, a number of high-profile diplomats arrived on 2 May 2006 in order to force a breakthrough in the negotiations. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hour extensions to the talks� deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US�s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N�djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee.

309,666,2,Sudan,625,Government of Sudan,SLM/A,666-19,"The seventh and final round of talks mediated by the AU started in Abuja on 29 November 2005. From the start of the seventh round of talks, the pressure on the conflict parties to sign a peace agreement steadily increased. The Western governments funding the peace process warned the parties that funding for the peace process could dry up in the absence of progress during the talks. The meetings of the seventh round of negotiations were held at different locations, but finished again in Abuja. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected. Instead, a number of high-profile diplomats arrived on 2 May 2006 in order to force a breakthrough in the negotiations. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hour extensions to the talks� deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US�s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N�djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee.

They encouraged him to write to Salim Ahmed Salim a letter in which he could specify on what was needed in order for him to sign the DPA. In his letter send to Salim on 10 May, Abdul Wahid proposed to conclude a �supplementary agreement� to the DPA, demanding greater representation at the legislature and executive bodies of Darfur, as well as a larger compensation fund for Darfur. However, Salim knew that the chief government negotiator, Majzoub El Khalifa, would reject this option, instead insisting that Abdul Wahid had to sign the DPA first, after which some of the remaining issues could be negotiated. Consequently, on 13 May 2006, Salim replied to Wahid that the AU could not re-open negotiations on the DPA, but was willing to support the conflict parties in implementing the agreement. Sam Ibok subsequently tried to persuade Wahid that the AU�s insistence on implementation rather than concluding a supplementary agreement would still allow Wahid to get what he wanted. Ibok�s effort to persuade Wahid did not work. Wahid kept insisting on a supplementary agreement. The AU Peace and Security Council decided on 16 May 2006 that the non-signatory groups would have another two weeks to sign the DPA.

The leaders discussed the prospects for peace in Sudan, but also agreed to end support for the armed opposition in each other's countries. While there were some talks on ending military support to the armed opposition groups in Darfur, the SLM/A did not engage in peace talks with the government between 2007 and 2011 in spite of some joint UN/AU mediation effort. In February 2007, a joint UN/AU mediation effort was initiated, headed by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, who respectively represented the UN and the AU. The SLM/A faction led by Minni Minnawi lost power and the movement was now led by Abdul Wahid. The SLM/A refused to attend the UN/AU organised negotiations in Sirtre, Libya. Hence, they were not involved in any negotiations with the Government of Sudan in 2007, although the SLM/A leadership did consult with the UN/AU negotiation team. In the beginning of 2008, the joint UN/AU mediation effort continued. Yet, no substantial progress was made. As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassol� assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no real negotiations took place. Abdul Wahid, the leader of SLM/A, demanded that security had to be provided for the civilians in Darfur before he would enter negotiations. Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort in 2009. SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid refused to leave his exile in Paris. Consequently, no negotiations were held between the SPLM/A and the Government of Sudan in 2009. In 2010, Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort. In contrast to several of the other rebel groups based in Darfur, the SLM/A and its leader Abdul Wahid refused to negotiate with the Government of Sudan until the security situation in Darfur would improve. In November 2011, the SLM/A � together with the Sudan People�s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM/A-North), the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Minni Minnawi (SLM/A-MM) � formed a new rebel coalition: the Sudanese Revolutionary Army (SRF).

309,666,2,Sudan,625,Government of Sudan,SLM/A,666-39,"Qatar began another mediation effort in early 2010, meeting with Sudan in late February and then Chad in early March. This mediation effort was led by Qatarese Emir Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. The agreement between Chad and Sudan concluded on 25 December 2009 was confirmed on 9 February 2010, when Chadian President Idriss Deby visited Sudan and met with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir. During the visit, Chad and Sudan signed a formal agreement in which they agreed that neither would support rebel organizations targeting the other. While there were some talks on ending military support to the armed opposition groups in Darfur, the SLM/A did not engage in peace talks with the government between 2007 and 2011 in spite of some joint UN/AU mediation effort. In February 2007, a joint UN/AU mediation effort was initiated, headed by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, who respectively represented the UN and the AU. The SLM/A faction led by Minni Minnawi lost power and the movement was now led by Abdul Wahid. The SLM/A refused to attend the UN/AU organised negotiations in Sirtre, Libya. Hence, they were not involved in any negotiations with the Government of Sudan in 2007, although the SLM/A leadership did consult with the UN/AU negotiation team. In the beginning of 2008, the joint UN/AU mediation effort continued. Yet, no substantial progress was made. As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassol� assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no real negotiations took place. Abdul Wahid, the leader of SLM/A, demanded that security had to be provided for the civilians in Darfur before he would enter negotiations. Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort in 2009. SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid refused to leave his exile in Paris. Consequently, no negotiations were held between the SPLM/A and the Government of Sudan in 2009. In 2010, Djibril Bassol� continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort. In contrast to several of the other rebel groups based in Darfur, the SLM/A and its leader Abdul Wahid refused to negotiate with the Government of Sudan until the security situation in Darfur would improve. In November 2011, the SLM/A � together with the Sudan People�s Liberation Movement-North (SPLM/A-North), the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), and the Sudan Liberation Movement/Army led by Minni Minnawi (SLM/A-MM) � formed a new rebel coalition: the Sudanese Revolutionary Army (SRF).

309,668,2,Sudan,625,Government of Sudan,SLM/A - MM,668-1,"The SLM/A-MM was part of the seventh and final round of the Darfur peace talks mediated by the AU. This round started in Abuja on 29 November 2005. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories, which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006. The rebel parties requested three more weeks to review the draft peace agreement, but this request was rejected. Instead, a number of high-profile diplomats arrived on 2 May 2006 in order to force a breakthrough in the negotiations. US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hour extensions to the talks� deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US�s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N�djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee. Zoellick also threatened Minni Minawi with possible UN sanctions or an International Criminal Court indictment if he did not sign the agreement. In addition, Zoellick threatened that an attack on Minawi�s forces in South Darfur by Sudanese troops would be executed if he failed to sign the DPA. Despite these threats, Minawi still had reservations when the final stretch of the Abuja talks started on 4 May, which were hosted by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo at his state house in Abuja. During a break of the plenary peace talks on 4 May, Zoellick allegedly told Minawi privately, �Have no doubt where I stand. I am a good friend and I am a fearsome enemy.� Minawi signed the DPA the next day, on 5 May 2006. However, the JEM and the SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid refused to sign the agreement, leaving the SLM/A led by Minni Minnawi as the only rebel party that signed the peace agreement. The agreement included a comprehensive ceasefire agreement, reaffirming the N�Dajema Agreement of April 2004. It aimed to integrate the forces of SLM/A and JEM into Sudan's security institutions, with 4000 soldiers joining the armed forces, 1000 joining the police, and 3000 receiving professional and educational training for civilian reintegration. The agreement covered both political representation and the future status of Darfur. In the political aspect, it focused on power-sharing at the national and state levels, establishing the Transitional Darfur Regional Authority (TDRA), and ensuring fair representation of Darfurians in Sudanese affairs. During the interim period until elections, SLM/A and JEM would be represented at the national level by a Senior Assistant to the President, chosen from a list of nominees provided by these two movements.",Abuja,Nigeria,1.0,2005,11.0,29.0,2006.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1,"AU, US, UK",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Other

309,11975,2,Sudan,625,Government of Sudan,SPLM/A-North,11975-9,"In December 2015, the Sudanese government and SPLM/A-North expressed to the AUHIP their willingness to sign a comprehensive agreement. An informal round of peace talks was subsequently held in Addis Ababa from 16 to 18 December 2015. However, this round of talks did not lead to an agreement, as the parties disagreed about whether the SPLM/A-North should be allowed to keep its troops. The conflict parties and the mediation team agreed to resume discussions in January 2016. A government attack on the SPLM/A-North in Aroum on 23 January 2016 led SPLM/A-North officials to publicly question the government�s commitment to establishing peace. In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas. The SPLM/A-N insisted on a provision allowing humanitarian access through Asosa in Ethiopia, but the Sudanese government rejected such a provision. In March 2017, the SPLM/A-North split into two factions, resulting in several clashes. While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks. The split was a result of long-simmering ethnic and political�military tensions within the SPLM/A-North in Blue Nile. While the Uduk, Berta, and Burun had made up the majority of the SPLM/A�s 10th Division during war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government between 1983 and 2005, members of the Ingessana tribe assumed increasingly more power within the rebel group from 2012 onwards. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the non-Ingessana tribes. Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-North and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated. In March 2017, SPLM/A-North deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu publicly released a resignation letter. Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-North movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu�s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-North to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe. The Nuba Mountains Liberation Council (NMLC) subsequently passed resolutions that removed Arman as the SPLM/A-North�s lead negotiator with the AUHIP, as well as put the NMLC in power of both South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Moreover, many senior non-Ingessana leaders began to publicly voice support for al-Hilu and the NMLC. In April 2017, almost all of the non-Ingessana Blue Nile Liberation Council (BNLC) members declared their support for the NMLC decision to dismiss Arman as the SPLM/A-North AUHIP lead negotiator. Accordingly, although the deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu broke away from the rebel group led by chairman Malik Agar, the UCDP codes the SPLM/A-North led by Malik Agar (SPLM/A-N-MA) as the splinter faction because the dismissal of Agar was endorsed by the NMLC and most of the BNLC.",Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,1.0,2015,12.0,16.0,2015.0,12.0,18.0,1.0,0.0,1,"AU, Ethiopia",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Other

Head of the team was Joseph Ocwet, Uganda�s ambassador to the African Union. On 30 August 2004, the Africa Relief Trust mediation team met with three LRA commanders at Abuga village, conducting talks to prepare the ground for formal negotiations. However, the initiative came to an abrupt halt when questions of the authenticity of the LRA commanders arose and the national army attacked a group of rebels that had reportedly been a part of the process, killing a LRA emissary. The LRA came under military pressure during the second half of 2004 when the Government of Sudan struck a deal with the Ugandan Government, allowing Ugandan forces to move further into Sudan to attack LRA forces. The LRA was severely weakened by November 2004. Accordingly, LRA spokesman Sam Kolo announced that the LRA was willing to enter negotiations. The Ugandan government also wished to negotiate, which led President Museveni to request Betty Bigombe, a former minister in the Ugandan Government, to put together a peace team, consisting of international observers of non-African nationalities, UN representatives, Acholi elders, and members of parliament. The team initially conducted informal talks with rebel officers, attempting to find out what the rebel�s demands were. As this became increasingly clear, Bigombe arranged a meeting between LRA officers and Acholi elders, which was one of the rebel�s pre-conditions for holding formal peace talks. All these efforts eventually led to a first direct meeting between the rebels and a government delegation, led by Ugandan Minister of Internal Affairs, Ruhakana Rugunda, on 29 December 2004. The conflict parties reached agreement on a total ceasefire and a signing ceremony was scheduled for 31 December 2004. However, the mediation team failed to finalise the accord, which resulted in the indefinite postponement of the signing ceremony.

The conflict escalated again in February 2005. After Bigombe communicated with Kony over the phone in April 2005, Kony attempted to set up a face-to-face meeting with Bigombe. Yet, this meeting never materialized due to logistical and security obstacles. In September 2005, Bigombe prepared a draft peace proposal, which President Museveni accepted as the starting point for further negotiations. However, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for LRA�s top five leaders before Bigombe had a chance to deliver it to Kony. Nevertheless, after discussions with President Museveni, Bigombe indicated that the door was still open for negotiations and Bigombe stayed in contact with the rebels throughout the rest of the year. The old troika of engaged countries � Norway, the UK, and the Netherlands � was joined by the US in April 2005. The four countries supported the peace team with personnel and financial means.

Several third parties were involved in the peace process in Uganda at different levels and at different stages during the year. Pax Christi, a Catholic peace movement from the Netherlands, managed to establish channels for contact between the LRA and the Government of Uganda, thus initiating pre-negotiations. Pax Christi also approached vice-President of the autonomous Southern Sudan, Riek Machar, as a potential mediator for negotiations. Machar had offered the conflict parties to mediate as early as November 2005. Instrumental in these initial efforts of Pax Christi was Leonzio Angole Onek, a Sudanses Acholi and former colleague of Riek Machar, who was provided with financial and logistical support by Pax Christi to set up negotiations between the conflict parties. Moreover, Machar was in a good position to initiate negotiations. Determined to get the LRA out of South Sudan, Machar gave the LRA three options: an ultimatum to either leave Sudanese territory peacefully, accept mediation with the Government of Uganda, or face military action. The threat of military action against the LRA remained implicit throughout the Juba peace talks. After a round of pre-negotiations in May 2006, the conflict parties officially agreed to mediation by Riek Machar and it was decided that the negotiations would start in Juba on 14 July 2006.",unknown,Uganda,2.0,2006,5.0,,2006.0,5.0,,2.0,0.0,1,"Sudan, Pax Christi, Netherlands, Switzerland, UN",0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Government-Related,Pre-Negotiation,Agreement Success

This announcement received widespread attention, since Kony and four of his deputies had been indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. At Juba, Machar was supported both by a mediation team within his vice-Presidential office and by a mediation group that included delegates of Pax Christi, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Switzerland provided a professional negotiator that assisted Machar during the talks, while Pax Christi provided the LRA delegates with training in negotiating. The Community of Sant�Egidio, who had been invited by the LRA, also attended the negotiations. UN representatives from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Political Affairs were also involved in the process to advice on issues related to the protection of internally displaced persons political aspects of the process respectively. The UN had initially been ambivalent regarding the Juba process being more supportive of the ICC position. Jan Egeland, the UN Emergency Relief Coordinator, faulted the Sudanese and Ugandan government for agreeing to talks to those indicted, stating that �Those who are indicted have been indicted because they are responsible for mass murder of the worst possible kind, and so those who are indicted should go and face justice in The Hague.� However, the UN became increasingly involved in the process over time and in October statements were made saying that the world body was firmly behind the process. The UN subsequently contributed 4.8 million US Dollars to sponsor the peace talks. In addition, in early December UN Secretary-general Kofi Annan named former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano his special envoy for LRA-affected areas. Chissano was mandated to develop a cohesive policy approach among all external actors in the peace process and to liaise with the ICC on questions regarding the indicted leadership of LRA. Neither Kony nor his top commanders attended the talks at Juba. Instead, the LRA delegation consisted of 14 negotiators, who had been appointed by Kony. Almost all of these 14 negotiators were Acholis from the Diaspora. The negotiation teams at Juba soon managed to agree on the issues that needed to be addressed in order to resolve the armed conflict: the cessation of hostilities, comprehensive solutions addressing the underlying issues of the conflict, reconciliation and accountability, the conclusion of a formal ceasefire, and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the fighters.

This agreement addresses how the conflict parties aim to establish a viable national alternative to ICC indictments against five top-LRA leaders, including Kony. The agreement provided for the establishment of a domestic legal framework that would function as a substitute for the ICC prosecutions. This was complemented by alternative processes like traditional justice. Under the accord, rebel commanders accused of serious crimes were to face formal criminal and civil justice proceedings in courts, which could impose �alternative penalties and sanctions� to replace existing punitive measures. However, the specifics of these alternative penalties and sanctions were not specified. Additionally, the agreement stipulated that abuses by the national army were to be pursued in the criminal justice system. Although another round of negotiations was scheduled in August 2007, no other peace talks were held during the rest of 2007. However, on 1 November, a LRA delegation went on a historic first trip to Kampala, where it released a white dove as a symbolic gesture of peace.

314,688,2,Uganda,500,Government of Uganda,LRA,688-43,"Two events resulted in uncertainty with regard to whether the Juba talks would continue in 2008. First, the LRA�s second in command, Vincent Otti had died in October 2007. Second, on 22 January 2008, LRA leader Joseph Kony sacked the head of LRA�s negotiating delegation, Martin Ojul, together with three others, accusing them of making money from the peace talks. Nevertheless, the Juba talks resumed on 30 January 2008 with the two sides extending the ceasefire the day before. The LRA team was now led by David Matsanga. Riek Machar continued to act as the chief mediator. In addition to the third parties already present in 2007, the US, the EU, Canada and Norway joined the talks. The conflict parties reached agreement on a number of issues. On 22 February 2008, the Implementation protocol to the Agreement on Comprehensive Solutions was signed. The protocol laid out the framework for the implementation of the Agreement on Comprehensive Solutions signed on 2 May 2007. According to the accord, the armed forces and security agencies were required to ensure that their recruitment and composition reflected the ethnic diversity of Uganda. Additionally, the agreement mandated the creation of an �Equal Opportunities Commission� shortly after the Final Peace Agreement�s signing. The primary responsibility of this commission was to investigate any regional or ethnic disparities and imbalances in government departments and institutions� participation. Furthermore, the agreement made provisions for the establishment of a �diaspora desk� within the Foreign Ministry. The purpose of this desk was to facilitate the repatriation and return of Ugandans residing abroad to their home country. On 23 February 2008, the Agreement on a Permanent ceasefire was signed. This agreement provided for an immediate truce, which was set to take effect 24 hours after the Final Peace Agreement's signing. As per the terms of the accord, all forces belonging to the LRA were required to be stationed within the Ri-Kwang-Ba assembly area, and a buffer zone surrounding it was to be respected. To monitor the cessation of hostilities, the existing Cessation of Hostilities Monitoring Team underwent transformation into a Ceasefire Monitoring Team. This new team consisted of five representatives from each of the parties involved in the agreement, five members from each of the AU observer countries participating in the peace talks, and a five-person liaison team from the UN. Additionally, it was specified that the Ceasefire Monitoring Team would be led by two senior officers from the SPLA. This arrangement aimed to ensure effective oversight and implementation of the ceasefire provisions outlined in the agreement. On 28 February 2008, the Agreement on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration was signed. This agreement established the Ceasefire Monitoring Team, which was created under the Agreement on a Permanent Ceasefire, with the primary responsibility of overseeing the disarmament and demobilization process. The accord specified that the Ceasefire Monitoring Team would develop a Disarmament Operations Plan, outlining the establishment of disarmament sites, among other details. Moreover, the Ceasefire Monitoring Team took on the task of facilitating the repatriation of ex-fighters from Ri-Kwan-Ba back to Uganda. The Government of Uganda was entrusted with the duty of identifying and preparing reception points for these returning individuals. Furthermore, the agreement granted former fighters the right to make a choice between joining the army or receiving reintegration support aimed at assisting them in their transition to civilian life. This provision aimed to offer these individuals the opportunity to pursue a path that best suited their aspirations and reintegration needs after leaving the armed forces. On 29 February 2008, the conflict parties signed the Agreement on Implementation and Monitoring Mechanisms. This agreement confirmed all the previous accords signed in the Juba process. It called for a transitional period of one month, commencing immediately after the Final Peace Agreement's signing, during which the Government of Uganda and the LRA were to prepare for the implementation of the Final Peace Agreement. As part of the accord, the parties agreed to develop an Implementation Schedule, which would be appended to the Final Peace Agreement, outlining all pertinent dates and timeframes for various actions and measures. Additionally, the Agreement on Implementation and Monitoring Mechanisms established an �Oversight Forum� responsible for overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the Final Peace Agreement. The forum would also offer advice and support to the parties and any relevant institutions created under the Final Peace Agreement. The Chief Mediator of the Juba process, Riek Machar, was designated as the chair of this forum, while the UN Secretary-General�s Special Envoy for LRA-affected areas, Joaquim Chissano, assumed the role of its spokesperson. Moreover, the agreement outlined the creation of a Joint Liaison Group, tasked with on-the-ground monitoring of the Final Peace Agreement's implementation in accordance with the Implementation Schedule.

The focus in the negotiations subsequently shifted to the provisions for a final ceasefire, followed by talks on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration. It is unclear whether Kony was briefed, but plans for the signing ceremony continued. On 3 March 2008, the LRA and Government of Uganda signed an agreement that included provisions for not only a ceasefire, but also disarmament and demobilization. On 10 April, all actors that had been involved in the Juba talks assembled at Ri-Kwangba to witness the signing of the final agreement. However, Kony did not show up, stating he wanted clarification on the issues of the Mato Oput (traditional judicial system) and the Special Division of the High Court. Kony stated he no longer trusted the mediators, claiming that they were in favour of the Government of Uganda. Kony also fired Matsanga, replacing him with James Obita.

To this purpose, Chissano held a series of separate meetings with President Museveni and Kony between April and July 2008. While the LRA continued to request further mediated negotiations, Uganda�s president Museveni stated in July 2008 that his government would not hold further negotiations with Kony. Instead, the Government of Uganda would wait for Kony to sign the Final Peace Agreement. On 11 September 2008, Machar declared the peace process over. Another signing ceremony was prepared in November 2008, but Kony again failed to show up. The LRA called for a ceasefire in January, March, and June 2009. However, the LRA was only willing to resume peace talks provided that another mediator would lead the process and that talks would be held at another venue. In October 2009, Matsanga stated that talks should be held on �neutral ground� such as in Kenya or Tanzania. Matsanga also claimed that Kony would prefer Nigerian ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo to act as the chief mediator. Machar conducted yet a final attempt at restarting negotiations at Juba by the end of September 2009.

In August 1997, President Museveni publicly stated that he was willing to pardon fighters from the ADF who turned themselves in. In October 1997, the ADF sent a list of preconditions for peace talks to President Museveni. These included power-sharing with the rebel groups, suspension of the country�s 1995 constitution that bans all political parties, and the release of all captured rebels. The Ugandan government did not respond to these demands. In May 1999, Roman Catholic leaders of the Ruwenzori region offered to mediate between the Ugandan Government and the ADF, but this offer was not accepted. In November 1999, the Chairman of the Ugandan district of Kasese, Yokas Mikande, and the Busongora South Minister of Parliament, Christopher Kibanzanga, held seven peace meetings with the commanders of the ADF in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The talks concerned the possibility of peace in the Ruwenzovi region in western Uganda.

Prior to this meeting, Mobutu had obtained a mandate to mediate from the conflict parties through separate meetings on two occasions with Savimbi and Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos to �restore peace and National Reconciliation in Angola.� He had also consulted the regional heads of state at a summit in Tokyo on 22 February 1989 and a conference of regional leaders in Luanda on 16 May 1989. According to some observers, Mobuto wanted to portray himself as a regional peacemaker, since he lost some influence due to the end of the Cold War. The Gbadolite Peace Agreement was signed on 22 June 1989.

This allowed the conflict parties to focus on the remaining key issues, which were the formulation of a unified national army, the setting of dates for a ceasefire and multiparty elections, and the international monitoring of implementation of an agreement. Of these remaining issues, the election date proved to be the most contentious point. While the MPLA government demanded the election to be held three years after the ceasefire date, UNITA proposed the elections to be held as early as nine months after the ceasefire. It was only after the US and the Soviet Union agreed to take part in the implementation process of the agreement that the conflict parties agreed to the elections taking place 18 months after the ceasefire would take effect, which was set for 15 May 1991. On 31 May 1991, the Bicesse Agreement was signed. The agreement established a ceasefire to be monitored by a joint commission, comprised of the two warring parties and a number of third parties. Furthermore, the agreement stipulated reforms of the military and security sector, creating an integrated army and a new police force. The agreement stipulated that both parties would contribute 20000 troops each to the new armed forces. The forces that were not integrated into the new army were to be demobilized and reintegrated into civilian life. The agreement allowed UNITA to become a legal political party. The agreement committed the parties to a multi-party democracy. An elections process was to be held in which the people would vote for a new President and a National Assembly. Political rights were extended, such as the freedom of expression and freedom of association. The authority of the central administration was extended to include the entire Angolan territory. The implementation of the peace agreement became the responsibility of the joint political-military commission. All civilian and military prisoners were to be released as a consequence of the agreement. The question of the return of exiles was to be discussed in the joint political-military commission. A variety of different mediation methods were used by the third parties to move the conflict parties towards the Bicesse Accords. First, the Bush administration made negotiations more attractive to the MPLA Government by promising that if the conflict parties would reach a negotiated settlement, then Washington would normalise relations with the MPLA Government and recognise it. Second, the third parties used military inducements, both through extending and refusing to extend military assistance. Seeking to maintain their position in Southern Africa, the US had been supporting UNITA, while the Soviet Union had been supporting the MPLA government. However, as the Cold War waned by the end of the 1980s, the conflict parties could no longer depend on unqualified support from their clients. Besides scaling back their support, both Washington and Moscow became increasingly willing to apply pressure to the conflict parties in favour of a peaceful solution to the conflict. The US drew on its patron client relationship with UNITA by urging the latter to make public statements calling for national reconciliation, making it easier for the MPLA government to reach out. The US had also tacitly assured dos Santos that with national reconciliation, the military aid to UNITA would be ended. In addition, the third parties guaranteed the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. The agreement stipulated that representatives of Portugal, the USA and the USSR, together with sub-groups and members of the government and UNITA, were to take part in the joint Politico-Military Commission (CCPM), with the task of overseeing the political and ceasefire process. It was also agreed that around 30 observer states would be involved in the implementation process, as well as a UN force of 800 people financed by a US grant of 40 million US Dollars. Moreover, President dos Santos was promised by US Secretary of State James Baker that �the USA had all the means to guarantee the implementation of the accords and also to prevent the accords being violated.�",unknwon,unknwon,3.0,1991,4.0,4.0,1991.0,5.0,15.0,1.0,0.0,1,"Portugal, US, Russia (Soviet Union)",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,Bicesse Agreement,1991.0,5.0,31.0,0.0,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Agreement Success

On 9 January 1998, negotiations took place in Luanda, attended by dos Santos together with a delegation from the government and UNITA. A new schedule was agreed for the implementation of the accord, stipulating that the terms of the protocol was to be fulfilled by 28 February. However, this failed to materialise. Since this deadline was yet again not met, the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on UNITA on 25 June 1998, which stipulated the freezing of UNITA�s foreign bank accounts and a ban on the purchase of Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin, as well as prohibited all air and water transport in and out of the territories controlled by UNITA. Savimbi had indicated on 6 June 1998 that if the UN would impose new sanctions, UNITA would regard this as an attack on UNITA to which it was ready to respond. Indeed, following the imposition of new UN sanctions, UNITA immediately seized control in some of the localities in which it had transferred power to the central government.

Exploratory talks between church leaders in Mozambique and a delegation from Renamo were held in Nairobi in August in 1989. The goal of these talks was to prepare for direct talks between the Government of Mozambique and the rebel movement. The talks were chaired by President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who had been officially requested to mediate by the Government of Mozambique on 21 July. The mediation efforts of Moi and Mugabe continued throughout the rest of the year, but they did not succeed in initiating direct negotiations because of disagreements about the who should be the mediator. Renamo demanded Kenya, its supporting nation, to act as the mediator. However, the Frelimo government agreed to this on the condition that Zimbabwe, its own ally, also played a role as a co-mediator. This condition was not acceptable to Renamo, which also dismissed Frelimo�s suggestion to proceed without any mediators, citing a lack of mutual trust.

The peace conference led to the signing of a peace agreement in Cotonou on 25 July 1993. In addition to the government and the NPLF, the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy (ULIMO) was also a signatory to this agreement. ULIMO had emerged in May 1991 as an anti-rebel party predominantly fighting the NPLF. The Cotonou Agreement established a ceasefire to be monitored by ECOMOG. As part of the agreement, the troops engaged in the conflict were required to remain in their respective locations until the process of encampment and subsequent demobilization could begin. The parties involved in the agreement also reached a consensus on the composition and scope of a transitional government. This transitional regime was granted full authority over the Liberian territory and incorporated several power-sharing arrangements across the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. The executive branch of the transitional government would consist of a five-member Council of State, with delegates selected by �prominent Liberians.� The transitional Assembly would comprise representatives from the government (13 members), the NPFL (13 members), and another armed group called the ULIMO (9 members). ULIMO was also given the right to nominate one delegate to the Supreme Court. Power-sharing principles were further applied in the formation of an elections commission, tasked with facilitating the preparations for general elections. Additionally, a general amnesty was declared, and a program was initiated to repatriate refugees and displaced persons. The agreement also included provisions for the release of all prisoners of war, aiming to foster reconciliation and stability in Liberia.",Geneva,Switzerland,1.0,1993,7.0,10.0,1993.0,7.0,17.0,1.0,0.0,1,"Benin, ECOWAS, OAU, UN",0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,Cotonou Peace Agreement,1993.0,7.0,25.0,0.0,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Agreement Success

341,761,2,Liberia,450,Government of Liberia,LURD,761-1,"A process to resolve Liberia�s conflict began on 17 September 2002, when a meeting was held at the UN to form an International Contact Group on Liberia that would seek to bring the Liberian government and LURD insurgents together for peace negotiations. The contact group composed of the Ghana, Morocco, Nigeria, the UK, France, the US, the AU, ECOWAS, and the UN. President Taylor had been rejecting the possibility of direct negotiations with LURD, but after international pressure from the Contact Group, as well as the fact that the rebels were rapidly approaching Monrovia, Taylor accepted mediated negotiations with LURD. At the same time, the Contact Group made it clear to the rebels that a government taken by force would not be internationally recognized. What is more, the LURD leadership was aware that continued fighting was a risk. LURD fighters had proven to be unable or unwilling to control territory, while Taylor�s forces in Monrovia were well-funded and battle-hardened. In other words, although LURD forces approach Monrovia, it was far from certain whether Monrovia could be taken. Indeed, as Sisk puts it, �a definite military victory could only have been the result of a more protracted war with its end game inevitably playing out in the streets of the capital Monrovia.� Moreover, Charles Taylor was recreating militia groups from the first civil war in the 1989-1996 period, as well as creating new forces such as the Jungle Warriors, indicating Taylor�s commitment to a prolonged war in case he would lose Monrovia. Seizing the window of opportunity created by the battle dynamics, international actors put the disputants under diplomatic pressure to engage in peace talks. The cumulative effect of the battle dynamics, international pressure, and calls for peace from civil society groups paved the way for Senegalese President Abdoulaye Wade, Chairman of ECOWAS, successfully initiating peace talks between the Taylor Government and LURD. On 7 and 8 February 2003, ECOWAS, the Inter-Religious Council (IRC) of Liberia, and Sierra Leone facilitated peace talks in Freetown.",Freetown,Sierra Leone,1.0,2003,2.0,7.0,2003.0,2.0,8.0,1.0,0.0,1,"ECOWAS, Inter-Religious Council (IRC) of Liberia, Sierra Leone",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,NGOs and Organizations,Other,Other
341,761,2,Liberia,450,Government of Liberia,LURD,761-2,"After having agreed on the venue and date for a more sustained peace process, Wade met with Charles Taylor once more in early 2003 to discuss possible candidates to assume the role of chief mediator. From a list with notables, including names as Archbishop Desmond Tutu from South Africa, Taylor chose General Abdulsalami Abubakar from Nigeria. Commenting on his choice for Abubakar, Taylor expressed that during an earlier visit to Nigeria he had been impressed with the calm and controlled way Abubakar managed his affairs. Subsequent negotiations mediated by Abubakar, within the framework of the ECOWAS Peace Process for Liberia, started in Akosombo in early June 2003. Throughout the negotiations, chief mediator Abubakar employed a mediation strategy aimed at facilitating consensus among the conflict parties. However, the negotiations were simultaneously influenced by pressure from external actors. Arguably the most external influence came from an indictment against Charles Taylor. Just as the negotiations were to begin, on 4 June 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was established by the UN Security Council, issued an indictment against Charles Taylor for complicity in crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone. Consequently, Ghana had to decide whether to hand over Taylor or not. Many of the participants commented on the possible removal of Taylor as being in violation with African hospitality. Indeed, in line with earlier statements on the absolute safety of all participants in the negotiations, the Government of Ghana refused to turn over Taylor. Nonetheless, later that same day, Charles Taylor left Accra and went back to Monrovia, while negotiations would continue according to schedule. Although Charles Taylor stayed in close contact with the representatives of the Government of Liberia present in Accra, his departure had a profound effect on the dynamics of the negotiations. Before the indictment of Taylor, the prospect for the conclusion of a peace agreement seemed bleak. Most participants of the negotiations believed President Taylor would never give up his presidency, while the rebel parties would never compromise on their main demand of Taylor�s immediate removal. These insurmountable positions remained relevant when Taylor left Accra, as he still had no intention of giving up the presidency. However, the indictment resulted in Taylor losing any last support from international partners and de-legitimatized him. It also affected the morale of his troops, who had not been paid in months at that time.

These negotiations took place within the framework of the ECOWAS Peace Process for Liberia and were mediated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar, the former Head of State of Nigeria. Throughout the negotiations, chief mediator Abubakar employed a mediation strategy aimed at facilitating consensus among the conflict parties. However, the negotiations were simultaneously influenced by pressure from external actors. Arguably the most external influence came from an indictment against Charles Taylor. Just as the negotiations were to begin, on 4 June 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was established by the UN Security Council, issued an indictment against Charles Taylor for complicity in crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone. Consequently, Ghana had to decide whether to hand over Taylor or not. Many of the participants commented on the possible removal of Taylor as being in violation with African hospitality. Indeed, in line with earlier statements on the absolute safety of all participants in the negotiations, the Government of Ghana refused to turn over Taylor. Nonetheless, later that same day, Charles Taylor left Accra and went back to Monrovia, while negotiations would continue according to schedule. Although Charles Taylor stayed in close contact with the representatives of the Government of Liberia present in Accra, his departure had a profound effect on the dynamics of the negotiations. Before the indictment of Taylor, the prospect for the conclusion of a peace agreement seemed bleak. Most participants of the negotiations believed President Taylor would never give up his presidency, while the rebel parties would never compromise on their main demand of Taylor�s immediate removal. These insurmountable positions remained relevant when Taylor left Accra, as he still had no intention of giving up the presidency. However, the indictment resulted in Taylor losing any last support from international partners and de-legitimatized him. It also affected the morale of his troops, who had not been paid in months at that time. These developments negatively affected Taylor�s bargaining position in the negotiations.",Akosombo,Ghana,1.0,2003,6.0,4.0,2003.0,6.0,,2.0,0.0,1,"ECOWAS, Ghana, Nigeria",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Other

On 5 August 2003, the conflict parties declared a ceasefire. Finally, on 18 August 2003, the Accra Agreement was signed. The Accra Agreement outlined the establishment of a transitional power-sharing government known as the National Transitional Government of Liberia (NTGL), which was scheduled to be installed on 14 October 2003 and mandated to govern until January 2006. The NTGL was granted full authority over the unified country. The NTGL comprised a total of 76 members, with representation from various parties: 12 members from the three warring factions, 18 members from political parties, seven members from civil society and special interest groups, and one member from each of Liberia�s 15 counties. The agreement also set a deadline for holding elections, which had to take place no later than 2005. In addition to reaffirming the earlier ceasefire, the parties agreed to a comprehensive national process that encompassed cantonment, disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation, and reintegration of the armed forces.

The Record of Understanding commits the conflict parties to curbing factional violence. It also established a ban on the public display and carrying of weapons. The parties further reaffirm the need for a democratically elected constitution-making body and that this parliament could have one or two chambers. It also stipulated the need for a transitional government of national unity. The Interim Constitution was adopted as the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa Act 200 of 1993.

Ahmed Baba Miske, a representative from Mauritania, and Edgar Pisani, a representative from France, also played a role in the mediation leading up to the National Pact. The National Pact was signed in Bamako, Mali, as a finalization of the Mopti Accord in 1991. The agreement established a new ceasefire, preventing any further troop movements and freezing the armed forces in their current locations. A military pact was formed, allowing voluntary integration of the Tuareg rebels into various branches of the armed forces, such as the military, police, or gendarmerie. Complete demilitarization of the North was planned. The agreement also modified Mali�s political structure by decentralizing authority to regional and sub-regional assemblies with executive powers. These assemblies had control over socio-economic, cultural, and budgetary aspects of governance. Special administrative structures were established for the Adrar region. To enhance representation, four seats in the assembly were designated for delegates from the Northern peoples of Mali. Efforts were made to integrate ex-rebels into different levels of government institutions, aiming for fuller inclusion of the Tuareg in the country�s political and economic spheres. FPLA�s representative in MFUA was Zeidane ag Sidi Alamine, who was a relative of FPLA leader Rhissa ag Sidi Mohamed. Rhissa and Zeidane disagreed about whether or not to sign the National Pact when it was on the table. Rhissa continued to refuse to sign, but Zeidane travelled to Bamako to sign it on behalf of the FPLA. However, with Zeidane unable to exert influence over the fighters on the ground at this point in time, attacks on government targets continued. On 27 March 1996, the so-called Flame of Peace ceremony was held in Timbuktu to symbolically mark the end of the armed conflict. Around 3,000 decommissioned weapons were destroyed in a giant fire.

Dinka was tasked to try to negotiate a settlement to the conflict and return the country to civilian rule, in collaboration with the OAU and ECOWAS. In December 1995, an OAU mission conducted negotiations with RUF representatives in Abidjan. The London-based International Alert, which had had helped to secure the release of European and Sierra Leonean hostages held by the RUF in April 1994, was instrumental in making contact with the RUF and helping to bring about the meeting between the rebels and the OAU, with the latter being represented by the Assistant Secretary-General for Political Affairs of the OAU, Daniel Antonio. The Government proposed a coalition government of national unity in 1996, but RUF refused to compromise. Moreover, the peace process soon broke down after the peace talks in Abijan. The main reason for this is that the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) toppled the Government of Sierra Leone in a coup on 25 May 1997 and took control of the Government, after which the RUF entered into an alliance with the AFRC. The AFRC was ousted from power in February 1998, when ECOMOG took control over Freetown.

The main issue that was agreed upon within this peace agreement revolved around changing the political and territorial setup of the Comoros. This involved granting significant self-governing powers to the various islands that make up this small country. However, the final structure of the political system was somewhat unclear, as it contained elements of federal, confederal, and autonomy-based solutions. It was explicitly mentioned that the central government would retain responsibility for matters such as external defense, religion, nationality, monetary policy, and foreign relations. Nevertheless, the specific powers to be delegated to the islands remained uncertain. Additionally, as part of the agreement, a new constitution was to be drafted and put to a referendum after a one-year transitional period. No third party had been involved in the negotiations leading up to this agreement. However, the agreement was severely criticized by the OAU on the grounds that it contravened the Antananarivo Agreement from 1999.

The peace talks led to the signing of the Famboni II Agreement on 17 February 2001. The agreement officially reinstated the Comoros as a federal entity. It outlined the requirement for the islands to adopt a new constitution that would clarify their relationship with the central government. This new constitution was scheduled to be submitted to a referendum before the end of June. Once the constitutional referendum took place, a transitional government of national unity would be established. Their responsibilities would include creating new institutions, organizing elections, and transferring power to civilian authorities by 31 December 2001. The existing regimes in Moheli and Anjouan would continue until the June referendum, but any members of these regimes intending to run for election would need to resign one week before the publication of the referendum results. Subsequently, a new transitional government would be formed to oversee the establishment of the new institutions. Finally, presidential and general elections were slated to be held in December 2001. However, the implementation of the accord was fraught with difficulties. Consequently, negotiations regarding the new constitution continued. In addition, three coup attempts took place, of which one was successful. In a coup taking place on 8 and 9 August 2001, Anjouan President Said Abeid Abd�r�mane was removed from power and replaced by a collective military presidency, which appointed a government consisting of eight civilian commissioners.

Indeed, congressional declarations clearly indicated that famine relief would not be withheld. EPRDF leader Meles Zenawi had pledged not enter Addis Ababa until after the London conference.

However, Norway struggled to initiate negotiations, which, according to Chairman of the Oromo Liberation Front Dawud Ibsa Ayana, was due to the government avoiding direct talks. Nevertheless, in 2004, representatives of Norway�s ministry of foreign affairs acted as go-between between the Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and OLF leaders Galassa Dilbo and Abiyou Geleta. The Norwegian delegation did not manage to make the two sides meet face to face. Various subsequent attempts to initiate negotiations occurred between September 2004 and 2008, but none of these attempts resulted in either shuttle or direct negotiations. From 27 September to 1 October 2004, Norway sponsored a conference of Oromo dignitaries in Bergen. According to OLF chairman, Ato Daud Ibsa, the Ethiopian government was approached to attend the conference, but refused the idea of any dialogue that includes the presence of a third party. Furthermore, the conference led to a diplomatic dispute when Prime Minister Meles Zenawi asked the Norwegian foreign minister why Norway allowed the OLF, which the Ethiopian government considers to be as a terrorist organization, to hold a conference in Norway, after which the Norwegian minister told the Ethiopian Prime Minster that Norway does not view the OLF the way the Ethiopian government views it. In September 2005, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi announced that he was willing to engage in an unconditional dialogue with OLF. However, when street protests in Oromiya were met by harsh government repression in November, the prospects for negotiations disappeared. In 2006, the OLF indicated its willingness to engage in negotiations on several occasions, but the government responded by describing the situation in Oromiya as a law-and-order issue. Norway had stopped trying to initiate direct negotiations between the conflict parties after 2005, but the Fafo Institute for Applied International Studies organised a seminar in Oslo in March 2007, gathering members of the OLF � including Lencho Letta, Dime Neggewo, Raha Abdi, and Hussein Hassan � to discuss a way out of crisis in Ethiopia. Later in 2007, on 15 August, the Government of Ethiopia ordered six Norwegian diplomats to leave the country, stating that Norway�s peace and reconciliation efforts, both between Ethiopia and Eritrea and between Ethiopia and various opposition groups, in the Horn of Africa were undermining Ethiopia�s security interests.

After two days of talks, on 1 November 2002, a joint statement was issued. This statement was referred to as the Lom� Ceasefire Agreement, outlining a basic agenda of future discussions. The Lom� ceasefire agreement together with the Abidjan agreement provided the basis for military intervention by ECOWAS and France. In spite of these third party peacemaking efforts, negotiations stalled, as rebels continued to demand the resignation of president Gbago, which was unacceptable to the Government of the Ivory Coast. The Government, in turn, insisted on the immediate disarmament of the rebels, which MPCI refused. Furthermore, the negotiations became increasingly complicated, as two new rebel groups � the MPIGO and the MJP � appeared in the west of the country. This negatively affected the level of trust between the Government and MPCI, resulting in the breaching of the truce on several occasions.

Ten delegations and 32 representatives were present, including representatives of Gbagbo�s government, Guillaume Soro of the MPCI, representatives of western rebel groups MPIGO and MJP, as well as the major Ivorian political parties and Alassane Ouattara. During the negotiations, the mediators promised that a monitoring committee would be set up to guarantee the implementation of the agreement. This committee would include representatives of France, the EU, the AU, ECOWAS, the UN, la Francophonie, the IMF, the World Bank, and the G8. On 23 January 2003, the parties signed the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accords. The agreement reasserts the importance of the Lom� Ceasefire Agreement. It outlines the establishment of a Government of National Reconciliation, which would be formed through a power-sharing arrangement among the conflicting parties. The composition of this government would involve individuals selected by the participating parties during the Round Table discussions. To ensure credible and transparent elections, the agreement requires the preparation of an electoral timetable. Additionally, upon assuming office, the Government of National Reconciliation would immediately commence the process of regrouping its forces under the supervision of French and ECOWAS authorities. Subsequently, steps would be taken to disarm and demobilize all forces involved in the conflict. The responsibility of the Government of National Reconciliation also includes the reconstruction of a national army and a national security force. A plan for the country's reconstruction is proposed, alongside the release and amnesty of detained military personnel who have not committed severe human rights violations. After the singing of the Linas-Marcoussis Peace Accords, the mediation mandate of France was reinforced through UN Security Council Resolution 1464 (4 February 2003), which welcomed French mediation and backed the French military intervention, referred to as Op�ration Licorne, with a Chapter Seven mandate.

Progress was made, but due to disagreements concerning voter�s eligibility, it soon became evident that the elections, scheduled to place on 31 October, would have to be postponed yet again. At an ECOWAS summit held in Nigeria in early October 2006, a new framework for the political transition was outlined. After the meeting, the ECOWAS leaders forwarded their recommendations to the AU Peace and Security Council meeting in Addis Ababa, where the recommendations were accepted and sent to the UN Security Council meeting, which then accepted the peace plan on 1 November. Rejecting the UN and its role in the conflict, Gbagbo presented a peace plan of his own as an alternative.

The president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaor�, who became the chairman of ECOWAS in January 2007, mediated the subsequent negotiations between Ivorian president Gbagbo and the three rebel movements. Mario Giro from the Community of Sant�Egidio was also involved in the mediation effort. While the mediation efforts in previous years had been characterised by external pressure and the threat of sanctions, the third parties mediating at Ouagadougou did not exert any pressure on the conflict parties. The talks led to conclusion of the Ouagadougou Political Accord on 4 March 2007. The agreement reinforced the commitment of the FN and the Ivorian government to the Linas-Marcoussis, Accra, and Pretoria agreements. It outlined several key provisions, including the merging of government and FN forces, as well as the deployment of joint patrols in the former ""zone of confidence"" that previously divided the government-controlled south from the FN-controlled north. Additionally, the agreement addressed the disarmament of militias and their reintegration through civic service programs. It granted amnesty for crimes committed since September 2000. The agreement also specified that presidential elections would be held once the identification and registration process of eligible voters was completed. Until the elections were conducted, a transitional government would govern the country. The agreement aimed for full implementation by 4 January 2008.

These negotiations mainly focused on the conclusion of a ceasefire, as well as on the release of some political prisoners taken by the government. The mediation team led by Mesfin considered a ceasefire unlikely to hold unless underlying political grievances were addressed, but they deemed that a reduction in violence was necessary to create the space for substantial negotiations. Hence, the negotiations first focused on the conclusion of a ceasefire. The conflict parties signed a ceasefire on 23 January 2014, which took effect the next day. The ceasefire committed the conflict parties to end offensive operations, freeze their forces in place, and refrain from attacks against civilians. The ceasefire also established a monitoring and verification mechanism.",Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,1.0,2014,1.0,2.0,2014.0,1.0,31.0,1.0,0.0,1,"IGAD, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Sudan",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,ceasefire,2014.0,1.0,23.0,0.0,,Government-Related,Conflict Resolution,Other

This Agreement concerns the details on the implementation of the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGONU) and the Transitional National Assembly (TNA), as well as the adoption of the transitional constitution. The agreement also specified that the SPLM/A-IO was allowed to deploy 1,410 security personnel in Juba and the government could deploy 3,420 security personnel. The ARCSS included a political power-sharing provision. To this purpose, Machar returned to Juba in April 2016. However, problems with the implementation of the ARCSS were already apparent prior to Machar�s return. Kiir had cast aside the power-sharing formula of the ARCSS in October 2015 by creating 28 states instead of ten states. In addition, in violation to the agreement, Chief of Staff Paul Malong had secretly brought a Dinka militia to Juba. With tensions increasing, fighting between the conflict parties eventually resumed in July 2016. This effectively suspended the peace process. Following the clashes, President Kiir issued a decree on an immediate ceasefire in the country on 11 July 2016. Yet, fighting continued. Riek Machar subsequently fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo while under attack of ground forces and helicopter gunships. Taban Deng Gai sought the support of some disgruntled SPLM/A-IO generals, after which Kiir appointed Taban Deng Gai as the vice president, replacing Machar. Riek Machar was later put under house arrest in South Africa. However, most of the SPLM/A-IO remained loyal to Machar. JMEC chairman Festus Mogae reported in October 2016 �near-daily violations� of the ceasefire by both parties, warning that these could �trigger an uncontrolled escalation of violence.�",Addis Ababa,Ethiopia,1.0,2015,11.0,3.0,2015.0,11.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1,"IGAD, Kenya, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Uganda, Sudan",0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,3,Outcome of the Meeting of the Principal Signatory Parties to the Agreement on Planning Implementation of the provisions in Chapter II of the Agreement,2015.0,11.0,3.0,0.0,,Government-Related,Other,Other

The meeting was aimed at addressing the aspirations of Libyans for stability, as well as tackling the country�s critical economic, social, and health challenges. Following the ceasefire declarations on 21 August 2020, the meeting�s objective was to reinvigorate the political process, initiating what the participants termed the Preparatory Phase for a Comprehensive Settlement. The group agreed to forward their recommendations to the forthcoming Libyan Political Dialogue, to be convened under UNSMIL. The recommendations from the meeting on Libyan stakeholders in Montreux, Switzerland, encompass a range of initiatives aimed at stabilizing and democratizing Libya. Central to these is the Preparatory Phase for a Comprehensive Settlement, a time-limited phase dedicated to establishing the necessary conditions for parliamentary and presidential elections within eighteen months, based on a mutually agreed constitutional framework. A significant restructuring of the executive authority was proposed, including the formation of a Presidency Council consisting of a president and two deputies, as well as a separate Government of National Unity. The selection of members for these bodies would be conducted through the Libyan Political Dialogue, with the Head of the Government of National Unity responsible for proposing the government and ensuring it reflects Libya�s diverse geographic, political, and social makeup.

Building on these ceasefire negotiations, the mediation effort in Nairobi was subsequently replaced by the Bangui Forum in which the government also participated. The United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African Republic (MINUSCA) provided political and logistical support to Bangui Forum. Abdoulaye Bathily, the UN Special Representative for Central Africa, chaired the Forum. Special Representatives were also sent by the African Union and the Republic of Congo to support the negotiations. Technical support and expertise were given to the mediations by HD and the EU. Around 600 representatives from the Central African Republic participated. The Bangui Forum was held between 4 and 11 May 2015 and led to the conclusion of two negotiated settlements. First, the parties concluded the Agreement between the Transitional Government and the armed groups on the principles of disarmament, demobilization, reintegration and repatriation and integration into the uniformed State forces of the Central African Republic on 10 May 2015. This agreement included provisions on a ceasefire, as well as on the disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration for all the armed groups that signed the agreement, including the Front populaire pour la renaissance de la Centrafrique, Rassemblement patriotique pour le renouveau de la Centrafrique, Union des forces r�publicaines fondamentales, Seleka r�nov�e, Mouvement des lib�rateurs centrafricains pour la justice, Front d�mocratique pour le progr�s de la Centrafrique, Coordination des ex-combattants anti-Balaka, Unit� du peuple centrafricain, R�volution et justice, and the Union des forces r�publicaines.

During this conference, a meeting was held between the CNDP, PARECO, the Government of the DRC, and the Government of Rwanda at the Ihusi Hotel in Goma on 16 January 2008. Although the UN representatives participated in the conference, the two chief mediators were Abb� Appollinaire Malu Malu and Vital Kamerhe. These two Congolese politicians had been mandated to mediate by the Government. Prior to the actual conference the chief mediators went on an extensive awareness-raising tour through North and South Kivu. On the basis of different consultations and meetings during this tour, they drafted a document specifying 15 objectives of the conference. While the organizers of the conference expected 600 participants, around 1500 people showed up at Goma at the start of the conference on 6 January 2008. The role of the UN representatives was twofold. First, the served as observers in order to ensure the neutrality of the talks. Second, in addition to participating in the plenary meetings, the UN representatives held secret bilateral meetings with Government of the DRC and the CNDP leadership. This led to PARECO ending its conflict with the CNDP on 17 January and the conclusion of a peace agreement between CNDP and the Government of the DRC on 23 January. In addition, the Congolese government and 22 armed groups signed a peace agreement � the Acte d�engagement � in Goma on 23 January 2008, committing all parties to an immediate ceasefire and the disengagement of forces from frontline positions.

Wamba�s power in the RCD-ML was being questioned by RCD-ML�s prime minister and member of an influential Nande family in North Kivu, Mbusa Nyamwisi and RCD-ML�s minister of mining, finance and budget and former head of the Kilo Moto gold mines in Ituri, John Tibasima, himself from Ituri and the Hema ethnic community. Their forces clashed in Ituri and ended with Wamba�s evacuation by the Ugandans in November 2000. This led to a lack of leadership in Ituri and a militarization of the communal conflict. Both Nyamwisi and Tibasima had trained and recruited soldiers for the RCD-ML from both Lendu and Hema communities and provided them with arms and training. With the lack of leadership, these soldiers now dispersed in their communities, which led to an intensification of the conflict between Hema and Lendu towards the end of 2000. A second round of heavy fighting erupted at the beginning of 2001. Lendu militias attacked Bunia for the first time, especially targeting UPDF headquarters and the airport. From 14 to 17 February 2001, the Front de Lib�ration du Congo (FLC) (English: Front for the Liberation of Congo), specifically via Jean-Pierre Bemba, mediated negotiations between the two groups.

This agreement stipulated an end to hostilities, as well as included a provision for the new governor to be from neither ethnic group and two vice-governors, one from each ethnic group. The agreement also tasked the FLC �with closing ethnic militia training camps, disarming civilians, deploying security forces, setting up peace tribunals throughout the region, rehabilitating prisons, and creating a special provincial follow-up committee.� The eminent persons present thereafter buried their machetes as a sign of reconciliation. Yet, the agreement was not fully implemented as Bemba lost control over Ituri in November 2001 after the disintegration of the FLC in June 2001 and several violent confrontations took place between RCD-ML and MLC.

Sahoun was mandated to work out a �plan whereby the United Nations could facilitate the cessation of hostilities between the Somali factions, promote reconciliation, and provide urgently needed humanitarian assistance.� By mid-October 1992, all major conflict parties agreed to a reconciliation conference. The Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi would act as the chief mediator of this conference that was scheduled to take place in Addis Ababa in January 1993. The UN Secretary-General would attend the conference as well. On 5 December 1992, the American-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF) was deployed in Mogadishu to create a secure environment for conducting humanitarian operations. However, the force was also used to move the conflict parties to the negotiation table. For instance, as soon as USC/SNA leader General Mohammed Farah Aideed made it clear that he would not participate in the Addis Ababa conference, the US attacked one of his camps in Mogadishu with 400 marines. Aideed subsequently agreed to come to Addis Ababa. From 4 to 15 January 1993, the UN � in collaboration with Ethiopia, the OAU, the Arab League, the OIC, and the US � convened a preparatory meeting for a conference of national reconciliation and unity in Addis Ababa between several Somali political movements. Both the SSDF and the USC/SNA attended these negotiations. In addition to hosting the talks, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi mediated the negotiations. In his opening speech, Boutros-Ghali emphasized that the UN peace enforcement mission deployed in December 1992 created a window of opportunity that would not remain open for long, stating that, �The world could forget about Somalia in a few minutes.� On 8 January 1993, the conflict parties declared a ceasefire that would take effect on 15 January 1993. The signatories also promised to end all hostile propaganda against each other.

With President Salva Kiir in power, many Nuer felt marginalized. Nuer and Dinka representatives attended a two-day peace conference in Unity State capital Bentiu on 11 and 12 September 2012. County commissioners and chiefs from Unity State attended the meeting, which focused on preventing cattle raiding in Unity State. The meeting ended with a vow to work towards establishing better relations between the different communities in Unity State. The conference was funded by USAID. Fighting between the Dinka and the Nuer escalated in the context of the civil war between Sudan People�s Liberation Movement/Army - In Opposition (SPLM/A-IO) and the Government of South Sudan that started in mid-December 2013, when two different factions within the Presidential guard clashed in Juba. One faction was loyal to President Salva Kiir, a Dinka, while the other faction was loyal to the former vice-president Riek Machar, a Nuer. Machar had been ousted from the government in July 2013. In mid-December 2013, President Kiir accused Riek Machar of conducting a coup d��tat, but this accusation later proved to be unsubstantiated. The accusation is widely seen as a pretext for crack down on Machar and pushing all Nuer troops out of Juba, after which Nuer civilians were targeted. Hilde Johnson, the UN Special Representative to the Secretary-General in South Sudan at the time, notes how what �clearly had been at first a fight between forces of the Presidential Guard loyal to the President and those siding with Riek Machar had degenerated into a deliberate massacre of Nuer, particularly Nuer males.� Armed clashes between government forces and the SPLM/A-IO quickly spread to other areas, in particular to Bor, Malakal, and Bentiu. Fighting between Dinka and Nuer also spread across South Sudan.

The members of the council subsequently investigated claims of deaths, injuries, and damage reported by the conflict parties.

The conflict parties accepted this judgment, resulting in the signing of a negotiated settlement at the end of the conference.

Machar further stated that a National Reconciliation and Peace Committee set up in 1994 would continue to work towards concluding a non-aggression pact between the SPLM/A and the SPLM/A-united. While there had been no fighting between Sudanese government forces and the SSDF, the SSDF announced a unilateral ceasefire on 12 March 1996, which the Sudanese government reciprocated. The SSDF and the government signed a ceasefire on 12 March 1996. This ceasefire paved the way for the conclusion of the Khartoum Agreement on 21 April 1997. This agreement turned Machar�s fighters essentially into a pro-government militia and the group changed its name to South Sudan Defence Force (SSDF). The SSDF received extensive support from the Sudanese government. The SSDF guarded the oil-rich territories under its control, as well as conducted attacks on the SPLM/A in areas controlled by the SPLM/A. While the conflict parties repeatedly clashed throughout 1997, there were relatively few clashes in 1998. One reason for this is that there was heavy fighting between rival factions within the SSDF. Riek Machar had proposed a different candidate than Paulino Matip for the gubernatorial elections in Unity State in December 1997. Since Matip�s forces were in control of most the oil-rich territory in Unity state, he saw losing political power in Unity as a significant threat to his business interests. This triggered Paulino Matip to try and remove Riek Machar from power and assume the leadership of the SSDF. Since this attempt was unsuccessful, Matip decided to create the South Sudan Unity Movement/Army (SSUM/A) and continue to fight the SSDF. The Sudanese government supported Matip and his SSUM/A fighters, allowing the SSUM/A to advance deep into Western upper Nile to clear the area for oil exploration. The SSUM/A gained the upper hand on the battlefield by late 1998. This led to a sidelining of Machar within the SSDF.

This somewhat reduced tensions between the Dinka dominated SPLM/A and the Nuer dominated SSDF. Crucially, the Sudanese government terminated its support to the SSDF in late 1999. In addition, many political leaders among the SSDF became increasingly frustrated with the lack of implementation of the Khartoum agreement between the Sudanese government and the SSDF which had been concluded in 1997. These changing circumstances explain why some leaders of the SSDF and the SPLM/A in the Upper Nile decided to build on the peace conference in Wunlit and initiate a peace meeting between the SSDF, the SPLM/A, and Simon Gatwec�s militia in Akobo on 18 August 1999.

4881,5491,3,"South Sudan, Sudan","625, 626",Bor Dinka,Mundari,5491-2,"Relations between the Mundari and the Bor Dinka were for a long time peaceful. This changed when, in 1983, the Sudanese government reneged on the Addis Abba Agreement that had been concluded in 1972. Contrary to this agreement, the Sudanese government divided southern Sudan into three different regions. The Dinka opposed this change, whereas the Mundari supported it. This worsened the relationship between the two ethnic groups. Tensions increased even more when the second civil war started in 1983. In 1986, the civil war reached the Mundari area and some Mundari militias began to fight alongside government forces. Yet, some Mundari fighters also fought under the banner of the SPLM/A from the late 1980s onwards and throughout the rest of the war. Tensions between the two groups remained following the end of the civil war with the conclusion of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005, particularly because of land conflicts and grievances among the Mundari leadership that they were excluded from power on the national level. This has led to occasional clashes between the Bor Dinka and Mundari in the Central Equatoria State in the post-CPA period, including after South Sudan gained independence in July 2011.

First, the commission was made up of a majority of Muslims, namely six Muslims for every Christian.
